Eventually some of his friends challenged him to go on a bike trip from Porto to Santiago de Compostela.</p>\n<p>He eagerly accepted, and after what turned out to be a great adventure, Sergio started a blog:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dahontrips.wordpress.com/category/expeditions/santiago-de-compostela/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://dahonrips.wordpress.com/category/expeditions/santiago-de-compostela/</a>{:rel=\"nofollow\"}</p>\n<p>Following the blog Sergio came up with the idea of establishing a store in Porto selling folding bikes, bike rental, and bike tours of the city center.</p>\n<p>There were some growing pains, and the sale of folding bikes is no longer part of the business.</p>\n<p>We are now exclusively dedicated to what we enjoy and do best, bike tours and rentals.</p>\n<p>We hope you now have a better understanding of the unique origin of the company name, and why we have kept it as a reminder of how it all began.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/dahon-bicycle.png\" alt=\"dahon bicycle\" title=\"dahon bicycle\"></p>","frontmatter":{"meta":{"title":"How Fold n Visit Born and History","description":"How Fold n Visit Born and History","noindex":null,"canonicalLink":null,"keywords":"How Fold n Visit Born and History"},"feature":null,"date":"October 28, 2017","title":"How Fold n Visit Born and History","language":"en","description":null,"tags":["company updates"]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ea140214-1b94-5be1-8299-73f9cdc77b32","language":"en"}}}

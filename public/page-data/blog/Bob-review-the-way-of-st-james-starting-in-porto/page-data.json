Six were guided as was this one. This tour is a notch above all the others. You are in the constant hands and service of Sergio and his carefully chosen guides. The biking can be challenging at times. We chose the basic package with the meal plan. The accommodation and meals were excellent. If you invest and trust in Sergio, you will be richly rewarded. He is truly one of a kind. If you are as lucky as we were to be matched with kind and generous fellow travellers, you too may also come away with one or more life long friends.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.pt/ShowUserReviews-g189180-d4105907-r532635022-Bike_tours_Portugal_City_Tours_Bike_rental_Fold_n-Porto_Porto_District_Northern_.html#REVIEWS\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.tripadvisor.pt/ShowUserReviews-g189180-d4105907-r532635022-Bike<em>tours</em>Portugal<em>City</em>Tours<em>Bike</em>rental<em>Fold</em>n-Porto<em>Porto</em>District_Northern_.html#REVIEWS</a>{:rel=\"nofollow\"}</p>","frontmatter":{"meta":{"title":"Cycling holiday review Bob","description":"Cycling holiday review Bob","noindex":null,"canonicalLink":null,"keywords":"Cycling holiday review Bob"},"feature":null,"date":"October 17, 2017","title":"Great Reviews about our bike tours in Portugal","language":"en","description":null,"tags":["Santiago de compostela","bike holidays","cycling holidays"]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"bcde7d5c-3aa0-5300-b52a-8544a89833f8","language":"en"}}}

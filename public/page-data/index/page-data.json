We were equipped with GPS with turn by turn instructions, no way to get lost. Douro valley is a beautiful and serene place to cycle, sometimes you feel like you have the whole place just to yourself. The villages and towns along the way are not touristy at all, very much maintained its local way of life. A great way to see beautiful nature and way of life in the wine country of Portugal. Really recommend a visit to the archeological site of Foz Coa to see the rock art our ancestor left us over 20,000 years ago and hear about the fascinating history of how it was discovered and the fight to preserve an important part of human heritage. Miss the nature, the sun and tranquility of Douro wine valley. Fold'n and Visit is the company to go with when you want to book tours in Porto or the countryside around it. Really recommend it for their service, care, attention to details and hospitality."},"html":"<p>Sergio arranged a really great 5 day (6 nights) tour for me with breathtaking views of Douro valley, interesting and challenging off roads, quite and tranquil back countries, and comfortable and quaint accommodations to relax in at the end of each day.

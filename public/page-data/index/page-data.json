Two GPS supplied with route loaded, finding the correct route in towns and leaving villages was a challenge. Lodgings and restaurants very nice, some staying open when we were the only guests. Sergio, Enrique and Diego, and Tripsite were extremely helpful daily! Thanks. We are home now, finished with the virus quarantine, well and ready to create a photo log of the trip.

Sergio took great care of us (there were another couple whose tour dates were the same as mine), checked from time to time to see how we are doing, any questions or problems we might have, and shared with us much information on the local culture. His other staff are also great, friendly and knowledgeable about their city. Sergio arranged for a free walking tour of Porto as part of the package, and when we were at Pinhao he took us to a vineyard for port wine tasting. We were equipped with GPS with turn by turn instructions, no way to get lost. Douro valley is a beautiful and serene place to cycle, sometimes you feel like you have the whole place just to yourself. The villages and towns along the way are not touristy at all, very much maintained its local way of life. A great way to see beautiful nature and way of life in the wine country of Portugal. Really recommend a visit to the archeological site of Foz Coa to see the rock art our ancestor left us over 20,000 years ago and hear about the fascinating history of how it was discovered and the fight to preserve an important part of human heritage. Miss the nature, the sun and tranquility of Douro wine valley. Fold'n and Visit is the company to go with when you want to book tours in Porto or the countryside around it. Really recommend it for their service, care, attention to details and hospitality."},"html":"<p>Sergio arranged a really great 5 day (6 nights) tour for me with breathtaking views of Douro valley, interesting and challenging off roads, quite and tranquil back countries, and comfortable and quaint accommodations to relax in at the end of each day.

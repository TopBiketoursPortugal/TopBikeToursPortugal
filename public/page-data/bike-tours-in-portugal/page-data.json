Famous for its beautiful landscape, history, gastronomy and also for producing the well-known and much appreciated green wine caste, “Alvarinho”.Every year this city organizes the “Festa do Alvarinho e do Fumeiro”, a huge event which is nationally and internationally known. This event showcases the local gastronomy (like the Alvarinho green wine) and many other local handmade crafts. Advancing to Monção, where the valleys are conducive to the practice of agriculture and viticulture, it is possible to find several archaeological finds that testify to a past filled with traces of the passage of different communities through these lands. The city of Valença is a historical town in the north of Portugal. It is located right on the border with Spain, separated by the beautiful Minho River, and surrounded by ramparts atop a hill, boasting a long defensive look.","title":"Day 2: Melgaço – Valença, (43 km) plus an extra track to Tui (6 km)"},{"day":"3","description":"Leaving Valença, continue along with the Minho river. One of today's destination is Caminha, a fortified town where several battles were fought between Portugal and Spain. Standing on a tiny island in the middle of the estuary are the ruins of the fort of Ínsua, built as a defensive measure concerning the entrance in the river during the XVth century. Nowadays there is a daily ferry-boat linking the two banks of the river between the countries. This city is also very well-known for its natural and green heritage: the sightseeing areas, waterfalls, beaches, camping parks and the “Modelo” beach (a favorite destination of famous people in Portugal). The midday stop is Vila Nova de Cerveira, the 'Village of the Arts'. The city became, after 1978, the meeting point of artists from all over the world. Cycle alongside the coast, overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, and you’ll reach Viana do Castelo. The city is one of the most beautiful seaside cities of the north of Portugal. Viana held a huge importance to Portugal in the Age of the Portuguese Discoveries and later on with the cod fish fishing. This city has a huge tradition and connection with the sea, with the fisherman proudly showcasing it nowadays, mainly during the great festivity of “Nossa Senhora da Agonia”. It was also here that the ships were built and later deployed to Brazil, India, Africa and other Portuguese colonies, during the XVth and XVIth centuries.","title":"Day 3: Valença – Viana do Castelo, 37 mi.

Its bridge, over the river Lima, built by the Romans in the 1st century, has always been a place of passage for the pilgrims who were going to Santiago. Ponte de Lima is the cradle of Housing Tourism, of the “Loureiro” variety that distinguishes the “Vinho Verde” and the Rice of “Sarrabulho” appreciated in the most faraway places in the world.","title":"Day 4: Viana do Castelo – Ponte de Lima, 16 mi.

Much of the territory is set within the confines of a nature reserve, the Reserva Natural do Estuário do Sado, a protected wildlife haven with a wealth of bird-watching possibilities.","title":"Day 2 -  Lisboa – Troia (65 km) * moderate dificulty"},{"day":"3","description":"Starting the day with some extensive sandy beaches, you will head towards Vila Nova de Santo André. This is a very multicultural city, which received a lot of people from Portuguese former colonies. The extensive forest that protects Santo André is a good example of the harmonious respect between the protection of the environment and the industrial development. Cycle through Comporta, a protected nature reserve and once fisherman village, now famous for its paradisiacal looking beaches, of great quality, and mild weather during the summer. Finishing the day you will be passing through the village of Melides, which dates back to the XIXth century. This village emerged as a small clump of fishermen and farmers. Its inhabitants are mainly dedicated into farming the land and handcraft activities, such as pottery and the making of cork stoppers.","title":"Day 3 - Troia - Vila Nova de Santo André (66 Km)"},{"day":"4","description":"You will cycle in the direction of Milfontes. Milfontes is the perfect combination of History and Nature, because it is situated on a beautiful coastline and it has been a region often raided by pirates. You will have the opportunity to discover the city of Sines where Vasco da Gama was born, the Portuguese explorer and first European to reach India by sea, connecting the West and the Orient in the 15th century. Nowadays it's remarkably known for receiving 50% of the countries’ exportations. In the village of Porto Covo is one of the most sought after by locals and tourists. With a spacious and sheltered beach, \"Praia Grande\", it is one of the busiest during the summer.","title":"Day 4 – Vila Nova de Santo André – Vila Nova de Mil Fontes (55 km)"},{"day":"5","description":"Quieter than Vila Nova de Milfontes, Zambujeira do Mar attracts more of a backpacker and surf crowd. Being a small sea side town on the coast of Alentejo, in western Portugal, it has some lovely sandy beaches and picture perfect traditional architecture, making it a small but loved destination for visitors. The town has some charming traditional buildings. Among the most notable ones are the fountains of Amores and Santa Catarina and the small, whitewashed chapel of Nossa Senhora do Mar. The beach is about 500 meters from the town of Almograve. It is a shallow but extensive beach with low tide, providing authentic natural pools.","title":"Day 5 – VNMF – Zambujeira do Mar (40 km)"},{"day":"6","description":"First you will be passing by Aljezur, an attractive village that straddles a river, its western part is Moorish, with a collection of cottages below a ruined 10th century hilltop castle. Vestiges of the old harbour can be seen in the narrow alleys that give access to the Ribeira de Aljezur. The 40km of coastline around Aljezur offers some of the most pristine and scenic beaches in Europe, with the whole area of river estuaries, sheer cliffs and dense marshes rich in bird and animal life. As the Alentejo turns into Algarve, the last coastal settlement is Odeceixe, an endearing small town with a beach classified as one of the 7 Wonders. The beach presents high quality landscape and biodiversity, being able to enjoy a landscape of rare and enormous beauty of the top of the cliffs.

The coast along this area is wild, with copper-coloured and ash-grey cliffs. Its landmarks include an old fort, a church and its high reddish rock formations, that look deceptively similar to Cape St. Vincent, in the southwest corner of Portugal. Carrapateira was traditionally a dangerous area for sailing ships. The extremely fast southbound current and the jutting headland that made it a dangerous lure for shipwrecks in the past, also creates the conditions which have made it a popular surfing destination in recent years.","title":"Day 7 – Aljezur – Carrapateira (30 km)"},{"day":"8","description":"A region of dramatic natural scenery, comprising of raging seas, towering cliffs and vast beaches, you are now cycling towards Sagres. There is little of historical or architectural interest as the original town bore the full brunt of the 1755 earthquake. Situated within a few kilometers from Europe's most south western point, stands Cape St. Vincent. The ferocious waves of the Atlantic Ocean pound the massive cliffs, while high above the immensely lighthouse, a light warns ships of the existence of these dangerous cliffs. The narrow streets which surround the main church contain many houses typical of the old Algarve, with whitewashed walls, bands of bright color, carved stonework around doors and windows.","title":"Day 8 - Carrapateira – Sagres (54 km)"},{"day":"9","description":"Lying along the bank of the Rio Bensafrim, with XVIth century walls enclosing the old town, we have Lagos. Lagos is a historic and lively city that offers visitors glorious beaches, nightlife and a charming historical center. Extending to the east of Lagos, you can found the 4km long \"Meia Praia\" Beach, which is the longest sandy beach on the western side of the Algarve. Aside from its hedonistic appeal, Lagos has historical clout, having launched many naval excursions during the Portuguese Age of Discoveries. Located about halfway between Lagos and Sagres there’s a picturesque fishing village, the little village of Salema. It is a paradise to those who are seeking tranquility and an escape from the crowded areas, where biking opportunities abound. The village is home to a number of fishermen who still cast their nets daily and moor their fishing boats on the shore. Finishing off this ride, blessed with both a beautiful beach and glorious climate, the \"Luz\" beach has a welcoming and friendly atmosphere, as the town has a significant permanent community of retired or emigrated expats. You’ll surely enjoy having the last stop of this fulfilling trip, in this amazingly, beautiful beach with lots of sights that provide a lovely and relaxing place to rest.","title":"Day 9 -  Sagres – Lagos (45 km)"},{"day":"10","description":null,"title":"Day 10 - Departure"}],"path":"/south-portugal-biketour/","physicality":1,"skillLevel":1,"tags":["Cycling Holiday","Alentejo","Lisbon","South","Center","Algarve","Mountain bicycle","touring bicycle","e-bike","electric bicycle","vicentine Coast","southwest bike tour"],"pricing":[{"price":1609,"discount":0},{"price":2060,"discount":null},{"price":2520,"discount":0}],"tourtype":"Bike","packagetype":"PackageTour"}},{"id":"d478e7a6-6c2d-5fb8-987b-69c2f285bedb","excerpt":"Silver Coast Atlantic Bike tour- West Coast and Sintra Discover the wealth of land and sea on the famous Portuguese Atlantic coast   This cycling tour is an immersive and amazing route, that goes alo…","html":"<h1>Silver Coast Atlantic Bike tour- West Coast and Sintra</h1>\n<h2>Discover the wealth of land and sea on the famous Portuguese Atlantic coast</h2>\n<p><br>\n<br>\nThis cycling tour is an immersive and amazing route, that goes along the coast and where you‘re going to find some of the most important villages in Portugal.

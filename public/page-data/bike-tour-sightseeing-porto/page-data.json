This included one hybrid bike and an electric assist bike for the wife, second tier hotel accommodation, the shuttle of our personal luggage between hotels, and a walking tour of Porto. We appreciated the personalized service given to us by insuring that we had the right size bikes, providing us with an emergency phone and Garmin GPS unit for route finding, and keeping in contact with us daily via email. All the hotels were able to provide us with breakfast with the exception of the one in Caminha. This latter hotel served breakfast too late and it was in a very noisy location with loud people on the street leaving club(s) between 5:30 to 6:30 a.m. Overall, the accommodations provided met our expectations. The cycling route worked out by the company exceeded my expectations and we appreciated that there was a good attempt to be faithful to the designated Camino which was not intended for bikes. The alternate routing needed in some places worked out really well. The GPS track was a necessity and hugely better than relying on maps.

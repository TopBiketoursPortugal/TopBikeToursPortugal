This included one hybrid bike and an electric assist bike for the wife, second tier hotel accommodation, the shuttle of our personal luggage between hotels, and a walking tour of Porto. We appreciated the personalized service given to us by insuring that we had the right size bikes, providing us with an emergency phone and Garmin GPS unit for route finding, and keeping in contact with us daily via email. All the hotels were able to provide us with breakfast with the exception of the one in Caminha. This latter hotel served breakfast too late and it was in a very noisy location with loud people on the street leaving club(s) between 5:30 to 6:30 a.m. Overall, the accommodations provided met our expectations. The cycling route worked out by the company exceeded my expectations and we appreciated that there was a good attempt to be faithful to the designated Camino which was not intended for bikes. The alternate routing needed in some places worked out really well. The GPS track was a necessity and hugely better than relying on maps.

This event showcases the local gastronomy (like the Alvarinho green wine) and many other local handmade crafts. Advancing to Monção, where the valleys are conducive to the practice of agriculture and viticulture, it is possible to find several archaeological finds that testify to a past filled with traces of the passage of different communities through these lands.

Standing on a tiny island in the middle of the estuary are the ruins of the fort of Ínsua, built as a defensive measure concerning the entrance in the river during the XVth century. Nowadays there is a daily ferry-boat linking the two banks of the river between the countries. This city is also very well-known for its natural and green heritage: the sightseeing areas, waterfalls, beaches, camping parks and the “Modelo” beach (a favorite destination of famous people in Portugal). The midday stop is Vila Nova de Cerveira, the 'Village of the Arts'. The city became, after 1978, the meeting point of artists from all over the world. Cycle alongside the coast, overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, and you’ll reach Viana do Castelo. The city is one of the most beautiful seaside cities of the north of Portugal. Viana held a huge importance to Portugal in the Age of the Portuguese Discoveries and later on with the cod fish fishing. This city has a huge tradition and connection with the sea, with the fisherman proudly showcasing it nowadays, mainly during the great festivity of “Nossa Senhora da Agonia”.

The destination is now Ponte de Lima, a city recognized as world heritage and stands as the ultimate North of Portugal in all its rusticity and scenic beauty. This land is full of history and is located in the former Braga-Tui military road. It is the oldest Portuguese village, since 1125 when it was granted charter. Its bridge, over the river Lima, built by the Romans in the 1st century, has always been a place of passage for the pilgrims who were going to Santiago. Ponte de Lima is the cradle of Housing Tourism, of the “Loureiro” variety that distinguishes the “Vinho Verde” and the Rice of “Sarrabulho” appreciated in the most faraway places in the world.","location":{"lat":"41.7675021","lng":"-8.5830992"},"title":"Day 4: Viana do Castelo – Ponte de Lima, 16 mi.

The cycling route worked out by the company exceeded my expectations and we appreciated that there was a good attempt to be faithful to the designated Camino which was not intended for bikes. The alternate routing needed in some places worked out really well. The GPS track was a necessity and hugely better than relying on maps. As for the of the itinerary of 6 days, the distances set by the company worked out really well and allowed us to complete each day at a reasonable time (as early as 2:30 p.m. and as late as 5:30 p.m.). Our average start time on the road was between 8:30 and 9:00 a.m. with a later start at Caminha because of the ferry crossing times. We truly enjoyed to long boardwalks along the beaches in Portugal.There are challenging sections on the route including steepness, as well as, rough and sandy trail surfaces, the kind of challenge I expected but could be overwhelming for some people. Keeping the latter in mind, I highly recommend this self-guided adventure.","relatedProduct":"SANTIAGO 01"}},{"id":"69220867-adb5-53cd-9e11-3cc97842f855","html":"<p>Não sou de fazer avaliações, mas esta fiz questão!!!

demarcated and classified wine region</h2>\n<p><br>\n<br>\nThe Douro valley is one of the ultimate wonders of nature. It is the culmination of the effort and energy of men and women, who through their labour gave shape to an already astonishing landscape. Travelling Douro is enjoying its convents and churches, meeting its rustic crafts, tasting the genuine cuisine and witnessing the Portuguese folklore traditions.</p>\n<p>Port Wine is undoubtedly the most famous product of this region. Douro comes to life during the summer and beginning of Autumn, with the several holidays and wine celebrations that happen at this time of the year. The harvest of the grapes is most likely the biggest and liveliest event of this region.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Route description</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mostly steep.

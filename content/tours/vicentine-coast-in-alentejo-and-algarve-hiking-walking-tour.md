      The day starts with an interesting ride towards the Vicentine Coast. It
      does take two hours, so it may very well leave even the less anxious of
      individuals ablaze and wanting to start exploring the landscape. The walk
      itself starts in Porto Covo, made famous among the Portuguese by a
      musician. It comprises a mixture of all types of terrain, although the big
      majority is done under unpaved ones. There is no real ascending or
      descending to get home and brag about, since the path crosses nearby the
      ocean and the beaches all the time. Pay attention to the fort of Santo
      Alberto do Pessegueiro, which you can’t visit, however you can spot it on
      a close by island.

      Take time to enjoy nature in all its splendor as the journey follows the
      coast towards south. Like the previous one, this walk remains flat and
      keeps diving into nature’s heart by crossing the existing dirt tracks
      along the coast. It is a short walk so that, by going slowly, nature has
      her time to show and reveal all her wonders. Almograve stands as a town
      that makes its living from agriculture, animal husbandry and fishing.

    description: >-
      This day will end up in Zambujeira do Mar, a place very well known between
      the Portuguese, as of one with pristine beaches and imposing cliffs. Take
      time to enjoy the high viewpoints over the ocean as it runs down in
      Atlantic fury against the rocks and lookout for the bird life that roams
      and nests in this natural park. The walk will take you through relatively
      flat areas. All kinds of terrain are to be expected.

      The beaches are beautiful and endless all along this region. The walk this
      day will take you to Casa da Seiceira with a typical and traditional blue
      line, near Azenhas do Mar. The walk keeps the tendency of being flat and
      of exploring a myriad of dirt and unpaved paths, where nature is still
      more genuine. Azenhas do Mar is a really small town which keeps a
      functioning and simple non industrial fishing harbor.

      The journey towards Odeceixe is done with the crossing of the border
      between Alentejo and the Algarve. This whole journey is a marvelous walk
      among the cliffs, until the river Seixe is in sight. The beach near the
      town of Odeceixe, where the river meets the ocean, was awarded the title
      of one of the 7 Wonder Beaches in Portugal.

    day: "2"
    description: The day starts with an interesting ride towards the Vicentine
      Coast. It does take two hours, so it may very well leave even the less
      anxious of individuals ablaze and wanting to start exploring the
      landscape. The walk itself starts in Porto Covo, made famous among the
      Portuguese by a musician. It comprises a mixture of all types of terrain,
      although the big majority is done under unpaved ones. There is no real
      ascending or descending to get home and brag about, since the path crosses
      nearby the ocean and the beaches all the time. Pay attention to the fort
      of Santo Alberto do Pessegueiro, which you can’t visit, however you can
      spot it on a close by island.

    title: "Day 3: Vila Nova de Mil Fontes – Almograve: 13 km "
    description: Take time to enjoy nature in all its splendor as the journey
      follows the coast towards south. Like the previous one, this walk remains
      flat and keeps diving into nature’s heart by crossing the existing dirt
      tracks along the coast. It is a short walk so that, by going slowly,
      nature has her time to show and reveal all her wonders. Almograve stands
      as a town that makes its living from agriculture, animal husbandry and
      fishing.

  - day: "4"
    title: "Day 4: Almograve – Zambujeira do Mar: 17 km (or 21 Km)"
    description: This day will end up in Zambujeira do Mar, a place very well known
      between the Portuguese, as of one with pristine beaches and imposing
      cliffs. Take time to enjoy the high viewpoints over the ocean as it runs
      down in Atlantic fury against the rocks and lookout for the bird life that
      roams and nests in this natural park. The walk will take you through
      relatively flat areas. All kinds of terrain are to be expected.

  - title: "Day 5: Zambujeira do Mar – Azenhas do Mar: 14 Km"
    day: "5"
    description: The beaches are beautiful and endless all along this region. The
      walk this day will take you to Casa da Seiceira with a typical and
      traditional blue line, near Azenhas do Mar. The walk keeps the tendency of
      being flat and of exploring a myriad of dirt and unpaved paths, where
      nature is still more genuine. Azenhas do Mar is a really small town which
      keeps a functioning and simple non industrial fishing harbor.

  - day: "6"
    title: "Day 6: Azenhas do Mar – Odeceixe: 12 km"
    description: The journey towards Odeceixe is done with the crossing of the
      border between Alentejo and the Algarve. This whole journey is a marvelous
      walk among the cliffs, until the river Seixe is in sight. The beach near
      the town of Odeceixe, where the river meets the ocean, was awarded the
      title of one of the 7 Wonder Beaches in Portugal.

    day: "7"
    description: This day starts in a flat path with dirt roads. Prepare to get out
      of the center and hike to the beautiful Vicentina Coast. Enjoy the Ocean
      basins and see the fishermen working. Upon arriving to Rogil try the
      Portuguese gastronomy with sardines or roasted seabass.

  - day: "8"
    title: "Day 8: Rogil – Aljezur: 13 KM (or 18 km)"
    description: This walk is pretty much flat with dirt paths. Today’s journey goes
      a little bit inland, so prepare to see some animals, like cows and boars.
      If you are a fan of bird watching this is also a very good day to admire
      the various species that live in this area. After reaching Aljezur, take
      time to admire the Aljezur Castle. It was used by both the Romans and the
      Arabs, and was conquered by the Portuguese in the XII century. This castle
      is one of those depicted in the middle of the Portuguese flag.

    day: "9"
    description: "This walk connects Aljezur and Arrifana. The route is of medium
      difficulty, mainly because it has some uphills hills with dirt and loose
      stones. Enjoy the variety of trees found in the area like ash, tamarind
      and willow trees, and take some time to admire the bays near the ocean
      that surrounds the village of Arrifana. "

    title: "Day 10: Arrifana – Carrapateira: 18 km"
    description: With an average difficulty, this walk is composed of dirt paths and
      a lot of ups and downs. Today’s journey takes you along untouched natural
      areas in the Vicentine Coast. When reaching the village of Carrapateira,
      dating back to the XIIth century, the main historical monument is the
      Carrapateira Fort, which was built in the XVII century in order to defend
      the village from pirate attacks.

    title: "Day 11: Carrapateira – Pedralva: 9 Km"
    description: This day’s walk is one of the easiest ones, with only 9 km of road
      ahead on flat dirt paths. Admire the beaches of the Vicentine Coast and,
      if you are a fan of bird watching, this area is for you to discover. Enjoy
      the rest of your day in Pedralva in the peace and privacy in that which is
      a protected village of Portugal.

      lng: "1"
  - day: "12"
    title: "Day 12: Pedralva – Vila do Bispo: 12 km"
    description: The day takes you through a flat and easy walk where its monumental
      cliffs provide the high point for stunning views over the ocean. In Vila
      do Bispo you may visit the local church built in XVIII century, and at the
      end of the day you may enjoy your meal with a dish of roasted sardines or
      shellfish.

      lng: "1"
  - day: "13"
    title: "Day 13: Vila do Bispo – Sagres: 24 km (or 10 km)"
    description: This walk might be the hardest one so far with quite a few ups and
      downs made in dirt paths and a substantial amount of kilometers to travel.
      Upon arrival into Sagres take a shortcut to Cabo de São Vicente to its
      Fort. This fort is consider one of the most important forts in Algarve,
      mainly because in the past it was a crossing zone between the Atlantic
      ocean and the Mediterranean sea.

# Vicentine Coast in Alentejo and Algarve Hiking & walking tour

## The south of Portugal through the coastline

### **Explore the famous Vicentine Coast and walk on the region of Alentejo and Algarve**

**Full hiking tour 13 days or 6 Days optional routes**

An amazing walking tour through one of Europe's best preserved regions. The southeast Alentejano Natural Park includes wild beaches surrounded by imposing cliffs, small mountain ranges, cork oak groves, traditional fishing villages, typical villages, spectacular views and important geographical points, such as Cape Sardão, the Cape of São Vicente, from where the caravels left for seas never before navigated, and Ponta de Sagres.

January to June or October to December is our recommendation for you to do this bike tour. It can get quite hot during the summer season, and that is something you should be aware of, if you decide to cycle in July, August or September.

Average temperatures in the Algarve, south of Portugal, are usually around 17ºC, and the weather is always sunny or partially sunny, as it is rare for it to rain in the southern regions, even during the winter.

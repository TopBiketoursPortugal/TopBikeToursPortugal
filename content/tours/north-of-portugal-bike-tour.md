    description: "The cycling trip starts in Melgaço, a city in the north of
      Portugal, on the banks of the Minho River. It is a small, beautiful and
      historical town, overseen by the tower of Homage, located high up in the
      old medieval area. It overviews the beautiful Minho valley, filled with
      vineyards that surround Melgaço and the nearby Peneda Geres park. Today
      you will also be meeting our local partner, including a tour presentation
      and explanation. Farm: [Reguengos de

    description: 'Melgaço is alongside the Minho River. Famous for its beautiful
      landscape, history, gastronomy and also for producing the well-known and
      much appreciated green wine caste, “Alvarinho”.Every year this city
      organizes the “Festa do Alvarinho e do Fumeiro”, a huge event which is
      nationally and internationally known. This event showcases the local
      gastronomy (like the Alvarinho green wine) and many other local handmade
      crafts. Advancing to Monção, where the valleys are conducive to the
      practice of agriculture and viticulture, it is possible to find several
      archaeological finds that testify to a past filled with traces of the
      passage of different communities through these lands. The city of Valença
      is a historical town in the north of Portugal. It is located right on the
      border with Spain, separated by the beautiful Minho River, and surrounded
      by ramparts atop a hill, boasting a long defensive look. Hotel 4 *:

    description: "Leaving Valença, continue along with the Minho river. One of
      today's destination is Caminha, a fortified town where several battles
      were fought between Portugal and Spain. Standing on a tiny island in the
      middle of the estuary are the ruins of the fort of Ínsua, built as a
      defensive measure concerning the entrance in the river during the XVth
      century. Nowadays there is a daily ferry-boat linking the two banks of the
      river between the countries. This city is also very well-known for its
      natural and green heritage: the sightseeing areas, waterfalls, beaches,
      camping parks and the “Modelo” beach (a favorite destination of famous
      people in Portugal). The midday stop is Vila Nova de Cerveira, the
      'Village of the Arts'. The city became, after 1978, the meeting point of
      artists from all over the world. Cycle alongside the coast, overlooking
      the Atlantic Ocean, and you’ll reach Viana do Castelo. The city is one of
      the most beautiful seaside cities of the north of Portugal. Viana held a
      huge importance to Portugal in the Age of the Portuguese Discoveries and
      later on with the cod fish fishing. This city has a huge tradition and
      connection with the sea, with the fisherman proudly showcasing it
      nowadays, mainly during the great festivity of “Nossa Senhora da Agonia”.
      It was also here that the ships were built and later deployed to Brazil,
      India, Africa and other Portuguese colonies, during the XVth and XVIth
      centuries. Hotel 4 *: [Melo Alvim Hotel](https://hotelmeloalvim.com/) or

      Portugal, with the beautiful Lima River alongside. The destination is now
      Ponte de Lima, a city recognized as world heritage and stands as the
      ultimate North of Portugal in all its rusticity and scenic beauty. This
      land is full of history and is located in the former Braga-Tui military
      road. It is the oldest Portuguese village, since 1125 when it was granted
      charter. Its bridge, over the river Lima, built by the Romans in the 1st
      century, has always been a place of passage for the pilgrims who were
      going to Santiago. Ponte de Lima is the cradle of Housing Tourism, of the
      “Loureiro” variety that distinguishes the “Vinho Verde” and the Rice of
      “Sarrabulho” appreciated in the most faraway places in the world. Hotel 4

      seaside city located in the North. During this day, you will be
      overwhelmed with seaside landscapes and small “Portuguese rivieras” until
      you reach Esposende, a city from the Middle Ages. Neiva river and its

      different viewpoints of Esposende, are just some of the interesting
      features of the county in which the richness of the natural landscape and
      heritage built by human hand, as is the case of windmills, fields in the

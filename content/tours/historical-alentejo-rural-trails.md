      you will face with the biggest Menhir in the entire Iberian Peninsula. The
      route today serves the purpose of discovering megalithic sites, especially
      when you enter in the Coureleiros Megalithic Park. The day will finish in

    description: "The area of Alentejo is known to be that of a region in harmony
      with nature, where humans explore for millennia what the land offers in
      what it is commonly known as Montado Alentejano. It is immediately
      noticeable the not so urbanized landscape, in a mixture of nature and
      agriculture exploration. There are two main hills to cross on this day’s
      walk, which will lead to Marvão. This little town is located on top of
      hill, which makes this walk peak at 820m, while starting at 520m. There is
      a mixture of all types of terrain. Some of the areas that might spark your
      interest during the day are: The medieval castle of Castelo de Vide, the
      synagogue of Castelo de Vide, Santa Maria da Devesa’s Mother Church,
      Marvão’s castle and the convent of Nossa Senhora da Estrela. Hotel: Dom

    title: "Day 4: Marvão – Ribeira de Nisa: 14 km"
    description: "Being this walk extensively more downhill, since it has to get
      from Marvão, at the top of a hill, down to Ribeira de Nisa, it allows for
      a good view point across the entire region. It mainly crosses farmed land.
      All types of terrain are to be expected, however the majority of it will
      be on asphalt roads. If with enough time, there is an old roman city on
      the waiting to be visited, called Ammaia, which is likely from the 1st
      century BC. Some of the areas that might spark your interest during the
      day are: The wonderful view of Marvão at Portagem, its roman bridge and
      Ammaia, an ancient roman city further down the day. Hotel: Convento da
      Proença"

      spotted during this day. Look for a sponge like tree bark, usually cut up
      to the upper half of it. The walk today is going to be mainly in paved
      roads with very low traffic. Take a walk around Fortios to see how the
      people live in rural areas. Hotel: Tapada da Eira e Chaça"

      of this well known natural structure which represents, in its purest form,
      the equilibrium between humans and the natural world. The final
      destination of this walk is Flor da Rosa.  Some of the areas that might
      spark your interest during the day are: The landscape along the day, and

    description: "Similarly to the previous day, this walk will be relatively flat,
      using mainly dirt paths in the middle of the Montado Alentejano. For the
      first quarter of the day it goes uphill towards Alter Pedroso, only to
      start progressively descending and ending at Cabeço de Vide. This town was
      stage for investigations from NASA, because according to this agency, this
      region has hydrogeological characteristics that are believed to be
      identical to those found in Mars in the past and possibly still in the
      present day. Some of the areas that might spark your interest during the

      for Olive tree farming. Some of the areas that might spark your interest

# **Historical Alentejo: rural trails**

**A hike to relax surrounded by cork trees and pastures**

Pure and simple. That is a simple way to describe Alentejo. The region seems to have remained a bit outside our time and it refused entering on our chaotic and frenetic way of living. A necessary relaxation and slow down of our natural present posture are necessary, to fully take in what this region offers. Alentejo does have one of the best Human Development Index values in the country, which might portrait how good it can be for us a little time off in the region.

**IMPORTANTE NOTE:** From June to September this is not a recommended tour due the heat. If you know what to expect from a 35º degree walking tour you may consider to book it.

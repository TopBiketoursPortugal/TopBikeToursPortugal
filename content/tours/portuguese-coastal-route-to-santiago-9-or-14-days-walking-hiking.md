    description: "Starting at the monument in Praia da memória, which represents the
      landing place of the troops that defended the city of Porto, during its
      long siege in the first half of the XIX century, a 20km walk awaits. This
      day’s walk is integrally flat with minor and imperceptible short climbs,
      to which contributes the low coast level of this area. It ends in Póvoa de
      Varzim, a city known to be historically connected to the sea.  Some of the
      areas that might spark your interest during the day are: the fish market
      at Angeiras, the almost imperceptible triangulation station of São Paio,
      the small and protected landscape of Vila do Conde Coast and Mindelo
      Ornithological reserve which you will pass through during your walk, Santa
      Clara’s Monastery in Vila do Conde, a replica of a Portuguese vessel
      called Nau in Vila do Conde and the fortress of Nossa Senhora da Conceição
      in Póvoa de Varzim, right at the end of this day’s walk."

    description: "Another flat day. It goes from Póvoa de Varzim to Esposende.
      Today, half of the day will be nearby the North Coast Natural Park, which
      goes from south of Apúlia to the river mouth of the river Neiva. This walk
      portraits an urbanized coastal area, with a decent amount of cobblestone
      roads in the company of farmed land and path walks near the beach. Some of
      the areas that might spark your interest during the day are: Masseira
      agriculture fields, which is a unique form of agriculture practiced in the
      dunes around this area and the fort of São João Baptista in Esposende."

      find a route with several ups and downs until your final destination.
      Prepare to admire the surroundings with a lot of natural landscape.
      Halfway you might notice the chapel of Senhora do Castro. In the same area
      there is a sightseeing viewpoint that captures the beautiful mountainous
      landscape. While in Viana do Castelo you can visit the Cathedral and the
      Santa Lúzia Sanctuary. "

    description: "Departing from Viana do Castelo this is the shortest walk so far.
      Almost nineteen kilometers separate Viana and Vila Praia de Âncora. The
      walk itself is flat done mainly on dirt paths and cobblestone roads. It
      conveys a naturalistic feeling, being most of the walk done in a not so
      urbanized coast, like in the previous one. Some of the areas that might
      spark your interest during the day are: The several forts and windmills
      you will find along the way, the lighthouse of Montedor and the Dolmen of
      Barrosa in Vila Praia de Âncora."

    description: "Continuing along the coast and keeping the same type of low land
      terrain, the walk today gets to the heart of the river that divides
      Portugal and Spain in their northernmost frontier. This is an easy walk,
      short in distance and elevation. Spain can already be seen in the previous
      walk, however today, it is clearly visible in a mountain which looks most
      like a volcano. Some of the areas that might spark your interest during
      the day are: The chapel of Santo Isidoro, the wayside cross of Santo
      Isidoro, Camarido woods by which you will pass near the end of this walk,
      the chapel of N. S. das Areias and the village of Caminha one and a half
      kilometers away from the hotel."

    day: "7"
    description: "The beginning of this walk leads to a fisherman boat, which will
      take it to leave Portugal and enter Spain. While being slightly less flat,
      the path follows the same tendency as the previous one, being majorly
      plane, with its highest point at 60m and lowest at 0m. This walk follows
      part of the road that connects Tui and Vigo through the coast, however
      touching it only occasionally when no alternative path exists. This road
      has a big shoulder in the form of a path for bicycles and pedestrians,
      which makes it safe. Some of the areas that might spark your interest
      during the day are: Sea Museum in Guarda, the several sightseeing points
      along the way and the monastery and town of Oia."

  - description: "Walking between Oia and Baiona feels like the previous walk. The
      same road is followed and in the same terms, although a big portion of the
      walk is done on the main road. The same protective shoulder exists every
      time the path stays on this road. A considerable portion of the path is
      asphalted road. Some of the areas that might spark your interest during
      the day are: The several sightseeing points along the way, the lighthouse
      of Cabo Silleiro, the old lighthouse of Cabo Sileiro, the coastal
      artillery of Cabo Silleiro, the statue of virxe da rocha, the castle of
      Monterreal, which is the location of the hotel and the museum of the

Walk towards Santiago using the Portuguese coastal path.Cross sunny and seaside areas such as Póvoa, Esposende, Vila Praia de Âncora, Caminha and Baiona.

Be in mind this is the original route to Santiago de Compostela “near” the Coast. It is possible to adapt the hiking route for a easier terrain. A big part of the pilgrims already walk near the sea, avowing some mountains and forest.

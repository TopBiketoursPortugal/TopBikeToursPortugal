    description: "Starting at the monument in Praia da memória, which represents the
      landing place of the troops that defended the city of Porto, during its
      long siege in the first half of the XIX century, a 20km walk awaits. This
      day’s walk is integrally flat with minor and imperceptible short climbs,
      to which contributes the low coast level of this area. It ends in Póvoa de
      Varzim, a city known to be historically connected to the sea.  Some of the
      areas that might spark your interest during the day are: the fish market
      at Angeiras, the almost imperceptible triangulation station of São Paio,
      the small and protected landscape of Vila do Conde Coast and Mindelo
      Ornithological reserve which you will pass through during your walk, Santa
      Clara’s Monastery in Vila do Conde, a replica of a Portuguese vessel
      called Nau in Vila do Conde and the fortress of Nossa Senhora da Conceição
      in Póvoa de Varzim, right at the end of this day’s walk."

      Today, half of the day will be nearby the North Coast Natural Park, which
      goes from south of Apúlia to the river mouth of the river Neiva. This walk
      portraits an urbanized coastal area, with a decent amount of cobblestone
      roads in the company of farmed land and path walks near the beach. Some of
      the areas that might spark your interest during the day are: Masseira
      agriculture fields, which is a unique form of agriculture practiced in the
      dunes around this area and the fort of São João Baptista in Esposende."

      find a route with several ups and downs until your final destination.
      Prepare to admire the surroundings with a lot of natural landscape.
      Halfway you might notice the chapel of Senhora do Castro. In the same area
      there is a sightseeing viewpoint that captures the beautiful mountainous
      landscape. While in Viana do Castelo you can visit the Cathedral and the
      Santa Lúzia Sanctuary. "

    description: "Departing from Viana do Castelo this is the shortest walk so far.
      Almost nineteen kilometers separate Viana and Vila Praia de Âncora. The
      walk itself is flat done mainly on dirt paths and cobblestone roads. It
      conveys a naturalistic feeling, being most of the walk done in a not so
      urbanized coast, like in the previous one. Some of the areas that might
      spark your interest during the day are: The several forts and windmills
      you will find along the way, the lighthouse of Montedor and the Dolmen of
      Barrosa in Vila Praia de Âncora."

    description: "Continuing along the coast and keeping the same type of low land
      terrain, the walk today gets to the heart of the river that divides
      Portugal and Spain in their northernmost frontier. This is an easy walk,
      short in distance and elevation. Spain can already be seen in the previous
      walk, however today, it is clearly visible in a mountain which looks most
      like a volcano. Some of the areas that might spark your interest during
      the day are: The chapel of Santo Isidoro, the wayside cross of Santo
      Isidoro, Camarido woods by which you will pass near the end of this walk,
      the chapel of N. S. das Areias and the village of Caminha one and a half

    description: "The beginning of this walk leads to a fisherman boat, which will
      take it to leave Portugal and enter Spain. While being slightly less flat,
      the path follows the same tendency as the previous one, being majorly
      plane, with its highest point at 60m and lowest at 0m. This walk follows
      part of the road that connects Tui and Vigo through the coast, however
      touching it only occasionally when no alternative path exists. This road
      has a big shoulder in the form of a path for bicycles and pedestrians,
      which makes it safe. Some of the areas that might spark your interest
      during the day are: Sea Museum in Guarda, the several sightseeing points
      along the way and the monastery and town of Oia."

      same road is followed and in the same terms, although a big portion of the
      walk is done on the main road. The same protective shoulder exists every
      time the path stays on this road. A considerable portion of the path is
      asphalted road. Some of the areas that might spark your interest during
      the day are: The several sightseeing points along the way, the lighthouse
      of Cabo Silleiro, the old lighthouse of Cabo Sileiro, the coastal
      artillery of Cabo Silleiro, the statue of virxe da rocha, the castle of
      Monterreal, which is the location of the hotel and the museum of the

      alteration visible along the way. A big portion of the walk is made along
      side an asphalted road, inside a protective shoulder, which is used by
      both cyclists and pedestrians. Some of the areas that might spark your
      interest during the day are: Senda dos Lagares near Vigo, beautiful place
      near the river where the path passes by, the monument to Elduayen, the
      monument to Jules Verne, the hill fort of Vigo, the Stone Market and the

    description: "The flat days are now left behind and the path starts to deviate
      from the coastal side. This walk is quite more hilly than any of the other
      ones so far. The first few kilometers are still made inside the busy and
      always shifting Vigo area. A constant degree of elevation is noticeable
      throughout the majority of the first half of this walk while climbing
      Penide hill, until the highest point of this walk is reached, at 430
      meters. After that a quick downhill follows. The final quarter of this
      walk is inside a valley. A good portion of this walk is paved, although
      there are plenty natural areas at the higher elevations. Some of the areas
      that might spark your interest during the day are: The oyster nursery
      areas near Vigo at the ocean entrance, the zoo of Vigo called Vigozoo and
      Mámoa do rei, a neolithic tumulus in the Penide hill."

    description: "The hills are here to stay and as such this walk is not an
      exception. With a cumulative total of 670m of uphill and downhill, a lot
      of the walk is through dirt or secondary paths. Encountering the main road
      is still expected, since the different paths divert from the main road and
      go through low to no traffic areas. There are two main hills between 160
      and 140m to cover during this walk. Some of the areas that might spark
      your interest during the day are: Ponte de San Paio, romantic bridge from
      the XIII century, church of Santa María de Ponte Sampaio. While in
      Pontevedra there is a whole repertoire of places to visit, serves as an
      example the monument to the heroes of the Sampaio bridge in Pontevedra,
      the convent of Saint Francis of Pontevedra, the chapel of the pilgrim
      virgin and the Spain plaza."

    day: "12"
    description: "From this day forward it is noticeable a clear change on the type
      of back roads that are taken to get to Santiago. There is a feeling of
      being cared for and having roads practically for pilgrims use. There is
      plentiful amount of dirt paths, mixed with paved secondary streets and the
      occasional visit to the main road. There are two main uphill areas, being
      the biggest right at the end of this walk in order to get to the hotel.
      Some of the areas that might spark your interest during the day are: The
      church of San Cristobal De Briallos, the thermal fountain of las Burgas in
      Caldas de Rei, the church of San Tomé Becket, the carballeira of Caldas de
      Reis, a small garden in the town, and the paths that follow along the
      river, those of which you will cross while getting to the hotel."

  - description: "With a total cumulative height of 530m, this walk has only one
      major hill to cross and a big downhill at the start, while getting down
      from the previous hotel. The walk feels much like the previous one in the
      type of roads and paths that are crossed, although leaning a bit more to
      the paved ones. The tendency of meeting the main road from time to time is
      still verifiable, since the path follows mostly around it. Some of the
      areas that might spark your interest during the day are: The church of San
      Miguel de Valga, the church of San Xulián de Requeixo at the entrance of
      the town of Padrón and the church of Santiago de Padrón where you can find
      the stone that gives name to the town."

    day: "14"
    description: "The last day is finally here. The walk towards Santiago might be
      one of the most challenging so far. This walk has a cumulative height of
      620m, being most of it uphill. The first half is relatively flat and only
      after do the roads start going up. The added motivation of having the
      final goal at reach certainly vitalizes the walker in order to help
      getting to Santiago. Some of the areas that might spark your interest
      during the day are: You certainly might want to pay a visit to the
      cathedral of Santiago de Compostela and to the pilgrims reception office
      in case you want to get a probate of your arrival to Santiago."

      urbanized coast, like in the previous one. Some of the areas that might
      spark your interest during the day are the several forts and windmills you
      will find along the way, the lighthouse of Montedor and the Dolmen of

    description: Continuing along the coast and keeping the same type of low land
      terrain, the walk today gets to the heart of the river that divides
      Portugal and Spain in their northernmost frontier. This is an easy walk,
      short in distance and elevation. Spain can already be seen in the previous
      walk, however today, it is clearly visible in a mountain which looks most
      like a volcano. Once in Caminha, try the Portuguese fishes, with sardines
      or roasted codfish.

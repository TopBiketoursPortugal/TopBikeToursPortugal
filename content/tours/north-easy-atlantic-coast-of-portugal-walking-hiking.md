      The first day starts in the city of Póvoa de Varzim and goes near the
      coast following the Caminho de Santiago Português da Costa. This day is
      flat, mixing coastal boardwalks with dirt terrains. Prepare to see
      beautiful beaches and also farming fields. Upon reaching the village of
      Apúlia, enjoy some of the delicious food that this town has to offer, like
      fresh sardines or octopus rice.

      roads. Take the opportunity to visit the Parish Church of Fão, a place of
      devotion for most pilgrims. Upon reaching Esposende and before going to
      the hotel, there is another place to take a look at, the Castro de São
      Lourenço. By climbing the mountain of Castro Lourenço you can see a
      fortified settlement, in which were found traces that go back to the
      century IV BC.

      On this route of 14 km the walking tour starts near the coast line, with
      paved roads and enjoying the beautiful beaches that the north of Portugal
      has to offer. The final destination is Castelo de Neiva. This is a city
      that dates back to the Iron Age, being later on, in the I and II centuries
      BC, Romanized. It is a must to visit the local Church that is very
      important to all the pilgrims that go to Santiago.

      Prepare to admire the surroundings with a lot of natural landscape.
      Halfway you might notice the chapel of Senhora do Castro. In the same area
      there is a sightseeing viewpoint that captures the beautiful mountainous
      landscape. While in Viana do Castelo you can visit the Cathedral and the
      Santa Lúzia Sanctuary.

    description: >-
      Nearly nineteen kilometers separate Viana and Vila Praia de Âncora. The
      walk itself is flat, done mainly on dirt paths and cobblestone roads. It
      conveys a naturalistic feeling, being most of the walk done in a not so
      urbanized coast, like in the previous one. Some of the areas that might
      spark your interest during the day are the several forts and windmills you
      will find along the way, the lighthouse of Montedor and the Dolmen of
      Barrosa in Vila Praia de Âncora.

    description: >-
      Continuing along the coast and keeping the same type of low land terrain,
      the walk today gets to the heart of the river that divides Portugal and
      Spain in their northernmost frontier. This is an easy walk, short in
      distance and elevation. Spain can already be seen in the previous walk,
      however today, it is clearly visible in a mountain which looks most like a
      volcano. Once in Caminha, try the Portuguese fishes, with sardines or
      roasted codfish.

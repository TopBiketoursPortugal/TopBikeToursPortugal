      province which belongs to Pontevedra. Padrón, the day's destination, is a
      region that belongs to the province of Coruña. This cozy village leads to
      Santiago, where, according to tradition, the Apostle Santiago preached in
      life, and where he returned again, after his martyrdom, on a stone ship
      that docked at "Pedrón" – a stone, hence the origin of the name, kept
      under the altar of the church of Santiago.

      You will be met by Santiago de Compostela as your final destination, one
      of the ultimate pilgrimage cores in Western Europe. Like Rome and
      Jerusalem, the city of Santiago de Compostela presents us an unique
      religious beacon for tourists who find in this cycling journey an act of
      faith and inner-self. Reach the Square of Obradoiro, where you will
      witness the majestic baroque cathedral where the remains of the apostle
      are located.

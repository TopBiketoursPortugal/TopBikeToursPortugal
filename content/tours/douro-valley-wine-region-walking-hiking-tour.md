# Douro Valley Wine region Walking & Hiking tour

## A demarcated and classified wine region

### 6 or 7 days hike tour

The Douro valley is one of the ultimate wonders of nature. It is the culmination of the effort and energy of men and women, who through their labour gave shape to an already astonishing landscape. Travelling Douro is enjoying its convents and churches, meeting its rustic crafts, tasting the genuine cuisine and witnessing the Portuguese folklore traditions.

Port Wine is undoubtedly the most famous product of this region.

The harvest of the grapes is most likely the biggest and liveliest event of this region.

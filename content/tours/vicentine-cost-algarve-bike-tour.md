      The journey starts in the city of Lisbon, Portugal's capital. This city
      has been influenced by many different cultures over the course of its
      history and it still maintains a village feeling in each historic
      neighborhood. The wide variety of landscapes and heritage is always close
      by, whether inj the north or south of the capital. Fado, prevalent in
      Lisbon, is a Portuguese traditional music style and is an expression of
      what it is to be Portuguese. It has been awarded the World Heritage
      status. You can hear it at night in a fado house or in a traditional
      neighborhood.

      Cycle through some lovely Portuguese cities, like the city of Montijo,
      strongly marked by the river. Like most of the localities of Ribatejo,
      Montijo has the tradition of the “brava” celebration, being bulls an
      bullfights an essential characteristic of the city's parties. Enter Pinhal
      Novo, which used to be the biggest vineyard in the country and, nowadays,
      it's an expanding urban centre. It is located near the Arrabida Natural
      Park. Bike along the pine brushed coastline of Parque Natural da Arrábida.
      End this first journey on a ferry to the pristine setting of the Tróia
      Peninsula, unquestionably one of Portugal's best-kept secrets. The
      peninsula's stands at the tip of a narrow spit of land comprised mostly of
      white sandy beaches fringed with shifting dunes and emerald pine forests.
      Much of the territory is set within the confines of a nature reserve, the
      Reserva Natural do Estuário do Sado, a protected wildlife haven with a
      wealth of bird-watching possibilities.

      Starting the day with some extensive sandy beaches, you will head towards
      Vila Nova de Santo André. This is a very multicultural city, which
      received a lot of people from Portuguese former colonies. The extensive
      forest that protects Santo André is a good example of the harmonious
      respect between the protection of the environment and the industrial
      development. Cycle through Comporta, a protected nature reserve and once
      fisherman village, now famous for its paradisiacal looking beaches, of
      great quality, and mild weather during the summer. Finishing the day you
      will be passing through the village of Melides, which dates back to the
      XIXth century. This village emerged as a small clump of fishermen and
      farmers. Its inhabitants are mainly dedicated into farming the land and
      handcraft activities, such as pottery and the making of cork stoppers.

      You will cycle in the direction of Milfontes. Milfontes is the perfect
      combination of History and Nature, because it is situated on a beautiful
      coastline and it has been a region often raided by pirates. You will have
      the opportunity to discover the city of Sines where Vasco da Gama was
      born, the Portuguese explorer and first European to reach India by sea,
      connecting the West and the Orient in the 15th century. Nowadays it's
      remarkably known for receiving 50% of the countries’ exportations. In the
      village of Porto Covo is one of the most sought after by locals and
      tourists. With a spacious and sheltered beach, "Praia Grande", it is one
      of the busiest during the summer.

      Quieter than Vila Nova de Milfontes, Zambujeira do Mar attracts more of a
      backpacker and surf crowd. Being a small sea side town on the coast of
      Alentejo, in western Portugal, it has some lovely sandy beaches and
      picture perfect traditional architecture, making it a small but loved
      destination for visitors. The town has some charming traditional
      buildings. Among the most notable ones are the fountains of Amores and
      Santa Catarina and the small, whitewashed chapel of Nossa Senhora do Mar.
      The beach is about 500 meters from the town of Almograve. It is a shallow
      but extensive beach with low tide, providing authentic natural pools.

      First you will be passing by Aljezur, an attractive village that straddles
      a river, its western part is Moorish, with a collection of cottages below
      a ruined 10th century hilltop castle. Vestiges of the old harbour can be
      seen in the narrow alleys that give access to the Ribeira de Aljezur. The
      40km of coastline around Aljezur offers some of the most pristine and
      scenic beaches in Europe, with the whole area of river estuaries, sheer
      cliffs and dense marshes rich in bird and animal life. As the Alentejo
      turns into Algarve, the last coastal settlement is Odeceixe, an endearing
      small town with a beach classified as one of the 7 Wonders. The beach
      presents high quality landscape and biodiversity, being able to enjoy a
      landscape of rare and enormous beauty of the top of the cliffs. It is in
      fact in this Natural Park, the only place in the world where you can
      observe the storks that nest on the cliffs.

      Leaving Aljezur to enter the surf-central Carrapateira, a  peaceful
      village with two nearby beaches with strong swells, which commonly attract
      surfers and visitors from Lisbon. The coast along this area is wild, with
      copper-coloured and ash-grey cliffs. Its landmarks include an old fort, a
      church and its high reddish rock formations, that look deceptively similar
      to Cape St. Vincent, in the southwest corner of Portugal. Carrapateira was
      traditionally a dangerous area for sailing ships. The extremely fast
      southbound current and the jutting headland that made it a dangerous lure
      for shipwrecks in the past, also creates the conditions which have made it
      a popular surfing destination in recent years.

      A region of dramatic natural scenery, comprising of raging seas, towering
      cliffs and vast beaches, you are now cycling towards Sagres. There is
      little of historical or architectural interest as the original town bore
      the full brunt of the 1755 earthquake. Situated within a few kilometers
      from Europe's most south western point, stands Cape St. Vincent. The
      ferocious waves of the Atlantic Ocean pound the massive cliffs, while high
      above the immensely lighthouse, a light warns ships of the existence of
      these dangerous cliffs. The narrow streets which surround the main church
      contain many houses typical of the old Algarve, with whitewashed walls,
      bands of bright color, carved stonework around doors and windows.

  - day: '9'
    description: >-
      Lying along the bank of the Rio Bensafrim, with XVIth century walls
      enclosing the old town, we have Lagos. Lagos is a historic and lively city
      that offers visitors glorious beaches, nightlife and a charming historical
      center. Extending to the east of Lagos, you can found the 4km long "Meia
      Praia" Beach, which is the longest sandy beach on the western side of the
      Algarve. Aside from its hedonistic appeal, Lagos has historical clout,
      having launched many naval excursions during the Portuguese Age of
      Discoveries. Located about halfway between Lagos and Sagres there’s a
      picturesque fishing village, the little village of Salema. It is a
      paradise to those who are seeking tranquility and an escape from the
      crowded areas, where biking opportunities abound. The village is home to a
      number of fishermen who still cast their nets daily and moor their fishing
      boats on the shore. Finishing off this ride, blessed with both a beautiful
      beach and glorious climate, the "Luz" beach has a welcoming and friendly
      atmosphere, as the town has a significant permanent community of retired
      or emigrated expats. You’ll surely enjoy having the last stop of this
      fulfilling trip, in this amazingly, beautiful beach with lots of sights
      that provide a lovely and relaxing place to rest.

# Vicentine Cost and Algarve Bike Tour

## From Lisbon or Sines to the south of Portugal through the coastline

\
\
An amazing biketour through one of Europe's best preserved regions. The southeast Alentejano Natural Park includes wild beaches surrounded by imposing cliffs, small mountain ranges, cork oak groves, traditional fishing villages, typical villages, spectacular views and important geographical points, such as Cape Sardão, the Cape of São Vicente, from where the caravels left for seas never before navigated, and Ponta de Sagres.

January to June or October to December is our recomendation for you to do this bike tour. It can get quite hot during the summer season, and that is something you should be aware of, if you decide to cycle in July, August or September.

Average temperatures in the Algarve, south of Portugal, are usually around 17ºC, and the weather is always sunny or partially sunny, as it is rare for it to rain in the southern regions, even during the winter.

\
\
**Route description:**

* Mostly flat. Some short and steep climbs, especially in the last day.
* 40 % secondary paved roads with low traffic, 40% dirt roads near the ocean and agricultural farms.
* 3628 meters ascent and 3637 meters descent

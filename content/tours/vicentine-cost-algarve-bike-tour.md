    description: "The journey starts in the city of Lisbon, Portugal's capital. This
      city has been influenced by many different cultures over the course of its
      history and it still maintains a village feeling in each historic
      neighborhood. The wide variety of landscapes and heritage is always close
      by, whether inj the north or south of the capital. Fado, prevalent in
      Lisbon, is a Portuguese traditional music style and is an expression of
      what it is to be Portuguese. It has been awarded the World Heritage
      status. You can hear it at night in a fado house or in a traditional
      neighborhood. Hotel 4 *: [Hotel Lisboa](http://www.hotellisboa.com.pt/)

    description: "Cycle through some lovely Portuguese cities, like the city of
      Montijo, strongly marked by the river. Like most of the localities of
      Ribatejo, Montijo has the tradition of the “brava” celebration, being
      bulls an bullfights an essential characteristic of the city's parties.
      Enter Pinhal Novo, which used to be the biggest vineyard in the country
      and, nowadays, it's an expanding urban centre. It is located near the
      Arrabida Natural Park. Bike along the pine brushed coastline of Parque
      Natural da Arrábida. End this first journey on a ferry to the pristine
      setting of the Tróia Peninsula, unquestionably one of Portugal's best-kept
      secrets. The peninsula's stands at the tip of a narrow spit of land
      comprised mostly of white sandy beaches fringed with shifting dunes and
      emerald pine forests. Much of the territory is set within the confines of
      a nature reserve, the Reserva Natural do Estuário do Sado, a protected
      wildlife haven with a wealth of bird-watching possibilities. Hotel 4 *:

      towards Vila Nova de Santo André. This is a very multicultural city, which
      received a lot of people from Portuguese former colonies. The extensive
      forest that protects Santo André is a good example of the harmonious
      respect between the protection of the environment and the industrial
      development. Cycle through Comporta, a protected nature reserve and once
      fisherman village, now famous for its paradisiacal looking beaches, of
      great quality, and mild weather during the summer. Finishing the day you
      will be passing through the village of Melides, which dates back to the
      XIXth century. This village emerged as a small clump of fishermen and
      farmers. Its inhabitants are mainly dedicated into farming the land and
      handcraft activities, such as pottery and the making of cork stoppers.

    description: "You will cycle in the direction of Milfontes. Milfontes is the
      perfect combination of History and Nature, because it is situated on a
      beautiful coastline and it has been a region often raided by pirates. You
      will have the opportunity to discover the city of Sines where Vasco da
      Gama was born, the Portuguese explorer and first European to reach India
      by sea, connecting the West and the Orient in the 15th century. Nowadays
      it's remarkably known for receiving 50% of the countries’ exportations. In
      the village of Porto Covo is one of the most sought after by locals and
      tourists. With a spacious and sheltered beach, \"Praia Grande\", it is one
      of the busiest during the summer. Hotel 4 *: [Hotel HS

      more of a backpacker and surf crowd. Being a small sea side town on the

      and picture perfect traditional architecture, making it a small but loved
      destination for visitors. The town has some charming traditional
      buildings. Among the most notable ones are the fountains of Amores and
      Santa Catarina and the small, whitewashed chapel of Nossa Senhora do Mar.
      The beach is about 500 meters from the town of Almograve. It is a shallow
      but extensive beach with low tide, providing authentic natural pools.

    description: "First you will be passing by Aljezur, an attractive village that
      straddles a river, its western part is Moorish, with a collection of
      cottages below a ruined 10th century hilltop castle. Vestiges of the old
      harbour can be seen in the narrow alleys that give access to the Ribeira
      de Aljezur. The 40km of coastline around Aljezur offers some of the most
      pristine and scenic beaches in Europe, with the whole area of river
      estuaries, sheer cliffs and dense marshes rich in bird and animal life. As
      the Alentejo turns into Algarve, the last coastal settlement is Odeceixe,
      an endearing small town with a beach classified as one of the 7 Wonders.
      The beach presents high quality landscape and biodiversity, being able to
      enjoy a landscape of rare and enormous beauty of the top of the cliffs. It
      is in fact in this Natural Park, the only place in the world where you can
      observe the storks that nest on the cliffs. Hotel 4 *: [Hotel

    description: "Leaving Aljezur to enter the surf-central Carrapateira,
      a  peaceful village with two nearby beaches with strong swells, which
      commonly attract surfers and visitors from Lisbon. The coast along this
      area is wild, with copper-coloured and ash-grey cliffs. Its landmarks
      include an old fort, a church and its high reddish rock formations, that
      look deceptively similar to Cape St. Vincent, in the southwest corner of
      Portugal. Carrapateira was traditionally a dangerous area for sailing
      ships. The extremely fast southbound current and the jutting headland that
      made it a dangerous lure for shipwrecks in the past, also creates the
      conditions which have made it a popular surfing destination in recent
      years. Hotel [Aldeia de Pedralva](https://www.aldeiadapedralva.com/) or

    description: "A region of dramatic natural scenery, comprising of raging seas,
      towering cliffs and vast beaches, you are now cycling towards Sagres.
      There is little of historical or architectural interest as the original
      town bore the full brunt of the 1755 earthquake. Situated within a few
      kilometers from Europe's most south western point, stands Cape St.
      Vincent. The ferocious waves of the Atlantic Ocean pound the massive
      cliffs, while high above the immensely lighthouse, a light warns ships of
      the existence of these dangerous cliffs. The narrow streets which surround
      the main church contain many houses typical of the old Algarve, with
      whitewashed walls, bands of bright color, carved stonework around doors
      and windows. Hotel 4 *: [Pousada

    description: 'Lying along the bank of the Rio Bensafrim, with XVIth century
      walls enclosing the old town, we have Lagos. Lagos is a historic and
      lively city that offers visitors glorious beaches, nightlife and a
      charming historical center. Extending to the east of Lagos, you can found
      the 4km long "Meia Praia" Beach, which is the longest sandy beach on the
      western side of the Algarve. Aside from its hedonistic appeal, Lagos has
      historical clout, having launched many naval excursions during the
      Portuguese Age of Discoveries. Located about halfway between Lagos and
      Sagres there’s a picturesque fishing village, the little village of
      Salema. It is a paradise to those who are seeking tranquility and an
      escape from the crowded areas, where biking opportunities abound. The
      village is home to a number of fishermen who still cast their nets daily
      and moor their fishing boats on the shore. Finishing off this ride,
      blessed with both a beautiful beach and glorious climate, the "Luz" beach
      has a welcoming and friendly atmosphere, as the town has a significant
      permanent community of retired or emigrated expats. You’ll surely enjoy
      having the last stop of this fulfilling trip, in this amazingly, beautiful
      beach with lots of sights that provide a lovely and relaxing place to

# Vicentine Coast and Algarve Bike Tour

## From Lisbon or Sines to the south of Portugal through the coastline

\
\
An amazing biketour through one of Europe's best preserved regions. The southeast Alentejano Natural Park includes wild beaches surrounded by imposing cliffs, small mountain ranges, cork oak groves, traditional fishing villages, typical villages, spectacular views and important geographical points, such as Cape Sardão, the Cape of São Vicente, from where the caravels left for seas never before navigated, and Ponta de Sagres.

January to June or October to December is our recomendation for you to do this bike tour. It can get quite hot during the summer season, and that is something you should be aware of, if you decide to cycle in July, August or September.

Average temperatures in the Algarve, south of Portugal, are usually around 17ºC, and the weather is always sunny or partially sunny, as it is rare for it to rain in the southern regions, even during the winter.

\
\
**Route description:**

* Mostly flat. Some short and steep climbs, especially in the last day.
* 40 % secondary paved roads with low traffic, 40% dirt roads near the ocean and agricultural farms.
* 3628 meters ascent and 3637 meters descent

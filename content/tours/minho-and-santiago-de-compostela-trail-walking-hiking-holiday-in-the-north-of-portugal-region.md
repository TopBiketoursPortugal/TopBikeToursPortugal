  - day: "1"
    title: "Day 1: Ponte de Lima"
    description: Welcome to the Ponte de Lima. It is considered the oldest villa in
      Portugal founded in the year of 1125. Located in the region of Minho, this
      town is known for its big baroque manors and plazas. Nonetheless, the best
      highlight of this villa is the famous Lima bridge built by the romans
      during the I century. This bridge is common and famous among pilgrims in
      their way to Santiago de Compostola, due to this town being one of the
      common resting places around this area. When it comes to the gastronomy
      department, you can enjoy the famous Vinho Verde and order Lamprey’s rice
      or Sarrabulho’s rice.

    title: "Day 2: Ponte de Lima – Cossourado: 22km"
    description: The beginning of this walk starts with the crossing of the Ponte de
      Lima bridge. The path itself is quite smooth, accompanied by a mixture of
      nature and rural landscape. A little church called Santa Marinha de
      Arcozelo might be noticeable after a while along the hiking. This small
      church is dated from the XIII century, followed close by a roman bridge
      called Arco da Geia. All along the way you might spot some small yellow
      arrows drawn in several different spots. This arrows are intrinsically
      related with the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, being them what
      pilgrims use in order to find the route to their final destination. The
      arrows may also be accompanied by an opposing blue one. The blue indicates
      the pilgrimage towards Fátima. Upon arriving to the final destination,
      take some time to visit the church of São Bento da Porta Aberta. At the
      end of the day enjoy the local gastronomy with a roasted codfish.

      so it is expected to see some other hikers along the way. The road itself
      can be a little difficult, since it is paved with coublestones. Along the
      way you might notice the church of Matriz Fontoura built in 1258. The end
      of the day is at the town of Valença do Minho. This little city is
      surrounded by big defensive walls and it is known for its Gothic and
      baroque military architecture. Valença do Minho is temptingly close to the
      border with Spain, so you may take the chance to cross the bridge and
      visit Tui in the region of Galiza. The gastronomy of this area is very
      vast, like the corn bread, fish stew or roasted lamb.

    title: "Day 2: Castelo de Vide – Marvão : 11km"
    description: "Starting at Castelo de Vide, known as the Sintra of Alentejo, this
      walk sets the standard for the journey to come. There are two main hills
      to cross on this day’s walk, which will lead to Marvão. This little town
      is located on top of a hill, which makes this walk peak at 820m, while
      starting at 520m. There is a mixture of all types of terrain. Some of the
      areas that might spark your interest during the day are: The medieval
      castle of Castelo de Vide, the synagogue of Castelo de Vide, Santa Maria
      da Devesa’s Mother Church, Marvão’s castle and the convent of Nossa
      Senhora da Estrela."

  - day: "3"
    title: "Day 3: Marvão – Ribeira de Nisa: 14 km"
    description: "Being this walk extensively more downhill, since it has to get
      from Marvão, at the top of a hill, down to Ribeira de Nisa, it allows for
      a good view point across the entire region. It mainly crosses farmed land.
      All types of terrain are to be expected, however the majority of it will
      be on asphalt roads. If with enough time, there is an old roman city on
      the waiting to be visited, called Ammaia, which is likely from the 1st
      century BC. Some of the areas that might spark your interest during the
      day are: The wonderful view of Marvão at Portagem, its roman bridge and
      Ammaia, an ancient roman city further down the day."

      lng: "1"
  - day: "4"
    title: "Day 4: Ribeira de Nisa – Portalegre - Fortios: 14km"
    description: "The common and widely known cork trees from Alentejo are easily
      spotted during this day, especially on the second part of the journey
      after crossing Portalegre. Look for a sponge like tree bark, usually cut
      up to the upper half of it. The most difficult portion of this walk is
      within the first two kilometers. There it passes by roughly 1km of a steep
      uphill. The rest of the walk is primarily a descent towards Portalegre
      and, later on, a nearly imperceptible descent towards the final
      destination, Fortios. Some of the areas that might spark your interest
      during the day are: The convent of Santo António nearby the city of
      Portalegre, the chapel of Calvário, Portalegre’s Castle and Cathedral and
      the chapel of São Sebastião at the final destination."

  - day: "5"
    title: "Day 5: Fortios – Crato: 17 km (or sleep in Portalegre: 25 km)"
    description: "This walk is the day of the Montado Alentejano. It crosses areas
      of this well known natural structure which represents, in its purest form,
      the equilibrium between humans and the natural world. The final
      destination of this walk is Crato. The name of the town, Crato, comes from
      the title that was concede to the chef of the Order of the Knights of St.
      John of Jerusalem in Portugal, commonly known in Portuguese as Ordem do
      Hospital. The journey itself is a constant descent towards Crato for the
      majority of the time, with a final smooth uphill to get to the place to
      stay overnight. Some of the areas that might spark your interest during
      the day are: The landscape along the day, the Crato’s castle and the
      museum house of Padre Belo."

      lng: "1"
  - day: "6"
    title: "Day 6: Crato – Alter do Chão: 17 km (or 21km)"
    description: "The distance of this walk depends on whether it starts in Cratos
      or Portalegre. If the start takes place in Cratos the distance to travel
      will only be 17km. The walk itself is rather flat when compared to some of
      the previous ones, with only a 100m difference between the highest and
      lowest points. Most of the path is made in unpaved roads. There is a small
      old dolmen called Anta de Crato which requires a two kilometer deviation
      from the course in order to visit. Some of the areas that might spark your
      interest during the day are: The dolmen of Crato, a megalith construction
      guessed to be around 5 thousand years old, Alter do Chão’s castle and
      pillory."

  - day: "7"
    title: "Day 7: Alter do Chão – Cabeço de Vide: 14 km"
    description: "Similarly to the previous day, this walk will be relatively flat,
      using mainly dirt paths in the middle of the Montado Alentejano. For the
      first quarter of the day it goes uphill towards Alter Pedroso, only to
      start progressively descending and ending at Cabeço de Vide. This town was
      stage for investigations from NASA, because according to this agency, this
      region has hydrogeological characteristics that are believed to be
      identical to those found in Mars in the past and possibly still in the
      present day. Some of the areas that might spark your interest during the
      day are: Remainings of Alter Pedroso’s Castle, the river beach of Jardim
      das Termas de Sulfúrea, Cabeço de Vide’s Castle and pillory."
    location:
      lat: "1"
      lng: "1"
  - day: "8"
    description: "Another practically flat day. The early uphill and following
      downhill are practically unnoticeable on this day’s journey. A big portion
      of this walk is in unpaved terrain in the middle of an area highly know
      for Olive tree farming. Some of the areas that might spark your interest
      during the day are: Torre de Palma, the place of your overnight stay which
      in the past was the area of a roman Villa owned by a roman family called
      Basilli."
    title: "Day 8: Cabeço de Vide – Monforte: 18 km"

      lng: "1"
  - day: "9"
    title: "Day 9: Loop Monforte: 16 km"
    description: "The last day walk is a visit to the town of Monforte. For the most
      part the day presents the typical smooth ups and downs of the Alentejo
      region. The only area of high slope is when climbing up to Monforte. The
      walk later returns back to the same hotel, Torre de Palma, although
      through a different route. All kinds of terrain, specially dirt, are to be
      expected. Some of the areas that might spark your interest during the day
      are: Monforte’s castle, the church of Nossa Senhora da Conceição and a
      roman bridge over Monforte’s stream."

    title: "Day 2: Baiona - Vigo: 25 km"
    description: "The path departs from Baiona towards Vigo. This walk feels as a
      densely urbanized area, with the ever present constructions and landscape
      alteration visible along the way. A big portion of the walk is made along
      side an asphalted road, inside a protective shoulder, which is used by
      both cyclists and pedestrians. Some of the areas that might spark your
      interest during the day are: Senda dos Lagares near Vigo, beautiful place
      near the river where the path passes by, the monument to Elduayen, the
      monument to Jules Verne, the hill fort of Vigo, the Stone Market and the
      Co-Cathedral of Santa María."

    title: "Day 3: Vigo - Redondela: 17 km"
    description: "The flat days are now left behind and the path starts to deviate
      from the coastal side. This walk is quite more hilly than any of the other
      ones so far. The first few kilometers are still made inside the busy and
      always shifting Vigo area. A constant degree of elevation is noticeable
      throughout the majority of the first half of this walk while climbing
      Penide hill, until the highest point of this walk is reached, at 430
      meters. After that a quick downhill follows. The final quarter of this
      walk is inside a valley. A good portion of this walk is paved, although
      there are plenty natural areas at the higher elevations. Some of the areas
      that might spark your interest during the day are: The oyster nursery
      areas near Vigo at the ocean entrance, the zoo of Vigo called Vigozoo and
      Mámoa do rei, a neolithic tumulus in the Penide hill."

    title: "Day 4: Redondela – Pontevedra: 21 km"
    description: "The hills are here to stay and as such this walk is not an
      exception. With a cumulative total of 670m of uphill and downhill, a lot
      of the walk is through dirt or secondary paths. Encountering the main road
      is still expected, since the different paths divert from the main road and
      go through low to no traffic areas. There are two main hills between 160
      and 140m to cover during this walk. Some of the areas that might spark
      your interest during the day are: Ponte de San Paio, romantic bridge from
      the XIII century, church of Santa María de Ponte Sampaio. While in
      Pontevedra there is a whole repertoire of places to visit, serves as an
      example the monument to the heroes of the Sampaio bridge in Pontevedra,
      the convent of Saint Francis of Pontevedra, the chapel of the pilgrim
      virgin and the Spain plaza."

    day: "5"
    description: "From this day forward it is noticeable a clear change on the type
      of back roads that are taken to get to Santiago. There is a feeling of
      being cared for and having roads practically for pilgrims use. There is
      plentiful amount of dirt paths, mixed with paved secondary streets and the
      occasional visit to the main road. There are two main uphill areas, being
      the biggest right at the end of this walk in order to get to the hotel.
      Some of the areas that might spark your interest during the day are: The
      church of San Cristobal De Briallos, the thermal fountain of las Burgas in
      Caldas de Rei, the church of San Tomé Becket, the carballeira of Caldas de
      Reis, a small garden in the town, and the paths that follow along the
      river, those of which you will cross while getting to the hotel."
    location:
      lat: "1"
      lng: "1"
  - description: "With a total cumulative height of 530m, this walk has only one
      major hill to cross and a big downhill at the start, while getting down
      from the previous hotel. The walk feels much like the previous one in the
      type of roads and paths that are crossed, although leaning a bit more to
      the paved ones. The tendency of meeting the main road from time to time is
      still verifiable, since the path follows mostly around it. Some of the
      areas that might spark your interest during the day are: The church of San
      Miguel de Valga, the church of San Xulián de Requeixo at the entrance of
      the town of Padrón and the church of Santiago de Padrón where you can find
      the stone that gives name to the town."

    day: "7"
    description: "The last day is finally here. The walk towards Santiago might be
      one of the most challenging so far. This walk has a cumulative height of
      620m, being most of it uphill. The first half is relatively flat and only
      after do the roads start going up. The added motivation of having the
      final goal at reach certainly vitalizes the walker in order to help
      getting to Santiago. Some of the areas that might spark your interest
      during the day are: You certainly might want to pay a visit to the
      cathedral of Santiago de Compostela and to the pilgrims reception office
      in case you want to get a probate of your arrival to Santiago."

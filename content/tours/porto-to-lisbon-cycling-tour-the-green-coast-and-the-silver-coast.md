      waves and the surfing. This happens due to a submarine geomorphological
      phenomenon, "Cannon of Nazaré", that allows the formation of giant and
      perfect waves. It is the largest submerged gorge in Europe, with about 170
      kilometres along the coast, which is 5000 meters deep. The Hawaiian surfer
      Garrett McNamara gave it worldwide visibility when, in 2011, he surfed the

      Market', where the castle and the surrounding town recreate the spirit of
      medieval Europe. The second one is the Chocolate Festival. This one also
      attracts great interest from tourists, amazed by the real-life chocolate
      sculptures. São Martinho do Porto is the city of passage today. This
      region constituted by the "Serra da Pescaria" and by the "Bouro" mountain.

      Peniche. The city was built on a rocky peninsula which is considered by
      geologists, a unique example of the Toarcian turnover during the worldwide
      Early Jurassic extinction. Peniche is known for its long beaches, which
      are popular for recreational activities and sports such as surfing,
      windsurfing, body boarding and kite surfing. These beaches are
      consistently windy, which allows for good surfing, with decent waves and
      supertubes. Berlengas islands, about 10 kilometres (6 mi) offshore from
      the peninsula, are part of the municipality. They form one of the world's
      first nature reserves. You will also be able to make a stop at "Lagoa de
      Óbidos", which is a lagoon that extends between the municipalities of
      Óbidos and Caldas da Rainha. It is a natural barrier that separate the
      Atlantic Ocean and marine biome from the river ecosystem of "Foz do
      Arelho" formed by lateral dunes.

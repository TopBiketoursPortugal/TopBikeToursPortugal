    description: 'This amazing cycling trip starts alongside the Atlantic Ocean in
      Figueira da Foz, a city in the center of Portugal, located in the district
      of Coimbra. Here you can enjoy one of the best beaches in Portugal since
      this city is known as the "Queen of the Portuguese beaches". In the middle
      of your journey you will get to Pedrogão. The citizens of this region have
      always been dedicated to agriculture and fishing, implementing traditional
      means known as "Xávega", a brand image that still persists. You will
      eventually get to your final destination São Pedro de Moel, surrounded by
      extensive areas of pine forests. This little town offers various points of
      leisure and communion with nature. A particular note is the famous "Volta
      dos Sete": a course of approximately 7 km, which combines sea, woods and
      beach, with pure forest, parks, fountains and streams. The typical dishes
      that stand out are the: "Vidreiro" soup, Cod soup and Rabbit stew. Hotel 4

    description: "Heading towards Nazaré, a beautiful and quiet seaside town, with a
      breathtaking view from the top of a big cliff, the ride today will be of
      shorter distance. Nowadays, the great attraction of this city are the
      waves and the surfing. This happens due to a submarine geomorphological
      phenomenon, \"Cannon of Nazaré\", that allows the formation of giant and
      perfect waves. It is the largest submerged gorge in Europe, with about 170
      kilometres along the coast, which is 5000 meters deep. The Hawaiian surfer
      Garrett McNamara gave it worldwide visibility when, in 2011, he surfed the

      enjoy amazing views of windmills, vineyards and surrounding farmlands. In
      the residential area below, narrow cobblestone streets are lined with
      whitewashed houses, supporting terracotta roofs. Every year the city
      organizes two important events, the first one is a traditional 'Medieval
      Market', where the castle and the surrounding town recreate the spirit of
      medieval Europe. The second one is the Chocolate Festival. This one also
      attracts great interest from tourists, amazed by the real-life chocolate
      sculptures. São Martinho do Porto is the city of passage today. This
      region constituted by the \"Serra da Pescaria\" and by the \"Bouro\"
      mountain. In previous geological times they formed a single island. When
      it was divided it gave rise to the bay of São Martinho do Porto. São

      Peniche. The city was built on a rocky peninsula which is considered by
      geologists, a unique example of the Toarcian turnover during the worldwide
      Early Jurassic extinction. Peniche is known for its long beaches, which
      are popular for recreational activities and sports such as surfing,
      windsurfing, body boarding and kite surfing. These beaches are
      consistently windy, which allows for good surfing, with decent waves and
      supertubes. Berlengas islands, about 10 kilometres (6 mi) offshore from
      the peninsula, are part of the municipality. They form one of the world's
      first nature reserves. You will also be able to make a stop at \"Lagoa de
      Óbidos\", which is a lagoon that extends between the municipalities of
      Óbidos and Caldas da Rainha. It is a natural barrier that separate the

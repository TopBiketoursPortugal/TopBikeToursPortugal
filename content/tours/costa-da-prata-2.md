      This amazing cycling trip starts alongside the Atlantic Ocean in Figueira
      da Foz, a city in the center of Portugal, located in the district of
      Coimbra. Here you can enjoy one of the best beaches in Portugal since this
      city is known as the "Queen of the Portuguese beaches". In the middle of
      your journey you will get to Pedrogão. The citizens of this region have
      always been dedicated to agriculture and fishing, implementing traditional
      means known as "Xávega", a brand image that still persists. You will
      eventually get to your final destination São Pedro de Moel, surrounded by
      extensive areas of pine forests. This little town offers various points of
      leisure and communion with nature. A particular note is the famous "Volta
      dos Sete": a course of approximately 7 km, which combines sea, woods and
      beach, with pure forest, parks, fountains and streams. The typical dishes
      that stand out are the: "Vidreiro" soup, Cod soup and Rabbit stew.

      Heading towards Nazaré, a beautiful and quiet seaside town, with a
      breathtaking view from the top of a big cliff, the ride today will be of
      shorter distance. Nowadays, the great attraction of this city are the
      waves and the surfing. This happens due to a submarine geomorphological
      phenomenon, "Cannon of Nazaré", that allows the formation of giant and
      perfect waves. It is the largest submerged gorge in Europe, with about 170
      kilometres along the coast, which is 5000 meters deep. The Hawaiian surfer
      Garrett McNamara gave it worldwide visibility when, in 2011, he surfed the
      world's biggest wave.

      Leaving Nazaré the next village is Óbidos. Without doubt this town is one
      of Portugal's most classic walled settlements and visitors can also enjoy
      amazing views of windmills, vineyards and surrounding farmlands. In the
      residential area below, narrow cobblestone streets are lined with
      whitewashed houses, supporting terracotta roofs. Every year the city
      organizes two important events, the first one is a traditional 'Medieval
      Market', where the castle and the surrounding town recreate the spirit of
      medieval Europe. The second one is the Chocolate Festival. This one also
      attracts great interest from tourists, amazed by the real-life chocolate
      sculptures. São Martinho do Porto is the city of passage today. This
      region constituted by the "Serra da Pescaria" and by the "Bouro" mountain.
      In previous geological times they formed a single island. When it was
      divided it gave rise to the bay of São Martinho do Porto. São Martinho do
      Porto was even considered the best beach to go with the family in the
      guide of 2015 beaches of eDreams.

      Returning to the coastal area, you will ride towards the city of Peniche.
      The city was built on a rocky peninsula which is considered by geologists,
      a unique example of the Toarcian turnover during the worldwide Early
      Jurassic extinction. Peniche is known for its long beaches, which are
      popular for recreational activities and sports such as surfing,
      windsurfing, body boarding and kite surfing. These beaches are
      consistently windy, which allows for good surfing, with decent waves and
      supertubes. Berlengas islands, about 10 kilometres (6 mi) offshore from
      the peninsula, are part of the municipality. They form one of the world's
      first nature reserves. You will also be able to make a stop at "Lagoa de
      Óbidos", which is a lagoon that extends between the municipalities of
      Óbidos and Caldas da Rainha. It is a natural barrier that separate the
      Atlantic Ocean and marine biome from the river ecosystem of "Foz do
      Arelho" formed by lateral dunes.

      Leaving Peniche but continuing along the coast the next destination is
      Ericeira. Ericeira is a civil parish and seaside resort/fishing community
      on the western coast of Portugal, in the municipality of Mafra, about 35
      kilometres (22 mi) northwest of the capital, Lisbon. Ericeira was a
      popular summer retreat for many of Lisbon's families in the 1940s and
      1950s. Today, it is a popular destination for local and visiting tourists,
      as well as surfers from around the world. Ericeira is also keen on its
      musical culture. The local philharmonic, currently named Filarmónica
      Cultural Ericeira, has existed since 1849 and pursues a path of success in
      this villages's musical heritage with a permanent free musical school for
      all who love this type of culture. The beach of Santa Cruz it´s the place
      of passage during this day, and it is a place that is conducive to a large
      part of wave sports. Every year there is the "Ocean Spirit" festival of
      wave sports where international competitions of various kinds are held.

      On this day, the route leaves the coast and goes to the city of Sintra.
      This place is known for its many XIXth-century Romantic architectural
      monuments, which has resulted in Sintra's classification by UNESCO as a
      World Heritage Site. It has become a major tourist center, visited by many
      one day-travellers who travel from the capital Lisbon. In addition to the
      Sintra Mountains and Sintra-Cascais Nature Park, the parishes of the town
      of Sintra are places with royal retreats, estates, castles and other

      of Cascais. Situated west of Lisbon it is a cosmopolitan suburb of the

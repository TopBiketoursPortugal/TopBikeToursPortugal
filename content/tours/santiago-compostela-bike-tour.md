      Before starting this cycling journey towards Santiago de Compostela, it's
      almost mandatory to explore Porto, classified as World Heritage and
      Capital of Culture and Tourism. Join us in a city walking tour and
      discover part of the heritage this city has to offer. Meet famous and
      well-known hot spots, such as the bookstore that influenced J.K. Rowling’s
      Harry Potter, the magnificent Stock Exchange Market, the blue and white
      tiles hiding at each corner and much more. Art, heritage and traditions
      are meant to be found and seen during this short city tour.

      From our store, based in the “Invicta” city of Porto, we will begin our
      journey heading to Esposende, a seaside city located to the North. During
      this day, you will be overwhelmed with seaside landscapes and small
      “Portuguese rivieras”. A huge variety of fishing villages will be met by
      us, where we can experience ancient traditions linked to the fish
      exploration, as well as taste this famous gastronomy. In Vila do Conde,
      you’ll know why these Portuguese coastal cities were so important during
      the “el dorado” of the Portuguese Discoveries

      We’re reaching Viana do Castelo, another sea docking city that was quite
      important during the Discoveries’ period. During the XIV-XVth Centuries it
      was in this precise city that the ships going to Brazil, India, Africa and
      other Portuguese Colonies were developed. Our final destination will be
      Caminha. This city finds the shore of the river Minho, making it part of
      an incredible landscape. Caminha is also very well known for its natural
      and green heritage, like the sightseeing areas, waterfalls, beaches and
      the camping park.

      You are going to enter in Spanish territory, ending in Bayona. It’s a city
      politically linked to Pontevedra, where you can breathe the sea breeze.
      Away from the sea landscape, you can also get lost in the old city center.
      Born from the Romans, the city kept growing towards the coast during the
      Middle Ages, with an influence from the Catholic Church. Curiously, during
      the XVI Century, Bayona was raided by British ships, led by the great
      corsair and explorer Francis Drake who saw an opportunity to establish a
      commercial and merchant point in this territory.

      This day will encompass the stream of Vigo and will end in San Simon's bay
      with a watery landscape to feast your eyes on. Always following the
      coastline, this day will be dedicated to Arcade and its famous oysters.
      Apart from this delightful cuisine, you will see monuments and sights
      dedicated to Santiago’s culture, such as the church of Santiago in Arcade
      (XII-XIII centuries) and roads and paths that will lead to our pilgrimage
      destination. It’s almost mandatory that, if you are passing by Arcade, you
      must taste and enjoy the famous oysters produced and harvested in the
      waters of this region. Curiously, during April’s first week there is a
      festival dedicated to this traditional gastronomy – “Fiesta de la Ostra” –
      where the city is filled with tourists and pilgrims to attend this event.

      Heading to a pre-Roman city, Caldas de Reis, a province which belongs to
      Pontevedra. According to historical archives, the first inhabitants were a
      pre-Roman community that lived from the hot springs of this territory. The
      name “Caldas de Reis” is connected to the birthplace of Afonso VII, acting
      in the Middle Ages as a pilgrimage path to Santiago de Compostela. Apart
      from the rich cultural heritage, like Arcade, Caldas de Reis holds a
      peculiar gastronomy, such as the “empanadas” of lamprey and the
      traditional Spanish bread. Since the hot springs accompanied the evolution
      of this territory, nowadays it is a hot spot for tourism who seeks better
      healthy treatments for several illnesses

      You will be met by Santiago de Compostela as your final destination, one
      of the ultimate pilgrimage cores in Western Europe. Like Rome and
      Jerusalem, the city of Santiago de Compostela presents us an unique
      religious beacon for tourists who find in this cycling journey an act of
      faith and inner-self. Reach the Square of Obradoiro, where you will
      witness the majestic baroque cathedral where the remains of the apostle
      are located.

## 5 ideas for original summer dates

### 1 – Walking Tours in Portugal

Summer hikes are quite normal these days. When night falls and the temperature drops, it's usual to see hundreds of people out walking, but there's nothing like the walks we're going to tell you about, which combine breathtaking natural landscapes, history, gastronomy and warm, hospitable people.

We're talking about [Walking & Hiking Tours Portugal](https://topwalkingtoursportugal.com/) by Top Walking Tours.

Among the many routes you can take advantage of are the Douro Valley route, which will allow you to visit and stay overnight in some of the region's most iconic estates, the Portuguese Way of St. James route along the coast, which combines the tranquil nature of Portugal's northern coast with the enchantment of the various historical monuments along the way, and the Historical Alentejo route, which will take you along trails full of monuments and invitations to romantic picnics under the stars.



### 2 – Parachuting

To take your love higher, how about trying a summer date that includes a parachute jump?

It's radical and full of adrenaline, but parachuting with your partner will be a unique experience to remember later... on video, as the various skycenters around the country (Évora, Maia, Braga, etc.) film the entire duration of the jump.

Prices vary between 30 and 3400 euros.

### 3 – Paragliding

Parachute jumping will give your relationship an immediate adrenaline boost, but if you want something in the air that lasts longer, a paragliding flight is ideal.

As we mentioned, unlike a parachute jump, a paragliding flight gives you all the time in the world to observe Portugal's landscapes and natural wonders.

### 4 – Take a bike ride

You may be thinking that there's nothing original about bike tours for two, but that's because you haven't heard of [Top Bike Tours](https://topbiketoursportugal.com/) which, like walking tours, take you through some of Portugal's most interesting and exclusive natural landscapes.

From the Silver Coast to the Vicentine Coast, via the Douro, the Alentejo and even the French Way of St. James, there's no shortage of adventures to be had as a couple.

### 5 – Private boat trip

After land and air, we end these five ideas for original summer dates with a private boat trip on the Tagus estuary.

In addition to total privacy (if you're only traveling with two crew members), a boat trip for two can also include catering with everything your loved one is entitled to and a stunning sunset with the city of Lisbon as a backdrop.

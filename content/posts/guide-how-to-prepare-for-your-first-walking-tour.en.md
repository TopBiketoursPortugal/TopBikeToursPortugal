## How to prepare for a Walking Tour?

During the process of preparing for a walking tour, you should pay attention to various aspects, including equipment, which is what we'll start with in this guide.

### Essential equipment

Taking into account the level of difficulty of the chosen route, you should take:

\- Ergonomic backpack with a capacity of between 10 and 20 liters;

\- Hiking boots/sneakers;

\- Lightweight, breathable and preferably seamless sportswear so as not to cause discomfort during the walk;

\- Walking stick (for more difficult trails);

\- Sunglasses and sunscreen;

\- A bottle of water;

\- Energy bars;

\- Map or GPS for unmarked routes;

\- First aid kit with Band-Aids, betadine, vitamin E cream and aloe vera for blisters on the feet;

\- Elastic socks/knees.



### Nutrition and Hydration

In the days leading up to the walk, try to eat balanced meals punctuated by carbohydrates, fiber and protein, such as pasta, rice, legumes and fruit.

On the morning of the walking tour, you could have a breakfast that includes, for example, granola (oats, almonds, puffed quinoa), a banana or a kiwi, cottage cheese and honey.

If you prefer, you could opt for a breakfast with wholemeal bread, two scrambled eggs, low-fat cheese and two kiwis.

The idea with this type of breakfast is to give you the energy you need for the first few kilometers and to delay your lunch break.

To compensate for the loss of water during the walk, drink at least 500 ml of water or tea an hour before setting off.

For the walk itself, take about 2 liters of water with you and try to hydrate regularly in order to limit wear and tear and compensate for the loss of water and mineral salts.

Tip: always take purifying tablets so that you can purify water taken from springs or wells.

As for food, you should focus on fruit, gels and energy bars, as they are easily and quickly absorbed. Try to eat every two hours.

For lunch, focus on salads, fat-free sandwiches and fruit.

### Mental preparation

As well as a good night's sleep, it's important to start preparing your mind for the hike by visualizing the stages and difficulties along the way, but without unrealistic expectations.

Once you're on the trail, just focus on one step at a time and try to enjoy the company and the natural, monumental and human landscapes that appear along the way.Â 

Take regular breaks, as these allow you to free your mind and help you recover for the next effort.

### Tips for increasing endurance

To increase your physical capacity and, consequently, your endurance, try doing these exercises in the weeks leading up to your hike:

\- Stair sequence: tones your muscles and increases your cardiorespiratory capacity.

\- Jumping rope: as well as working several muscles simultaneously, jumping rope helps with breath control and flexibility.

\- Swimming: swimming increases the endurance of your lower limbs, helps you lose weight and strengthens your joints and ligaments.

\- Running: increases cardiovascular and respiratory capacity, contributes to a significant improvement in blood circulation and helps you lose weight.

\- Functional training: by including running, jumping and squats, functional training in cycles allows you to increase breath control, improve heart function and tone the lower train.

### Safety tips

To be able to enjoy your walk in complete safety, look around:

\- Do not stray from the trail and/or your group;

\- Notify friends, family and, in some cases, even the local authorities of the route of your planned return time;

\- Respect your own pace and that of the rest of the group;

\- Remain alert throughout the route;

\- Dress to be seen, especially if you are hiking at night;

\- Carry a first aid kit.

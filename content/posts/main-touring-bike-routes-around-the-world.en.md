You don't have to be a Pogačar, a Vingaard or a João Almeida to be dazzled by the magnificent landscapes offered by a Tour de France, a Giro d'Italia or a Tour of Colombia, you just need a touring bike and a deep desire for adventure.

## Main Touring Bike Routes in the World

If in João Almeida's homeland there's no mistaking the fact that all roads lead to [Top Bike Tours Portugal](https://www.topbiketoursportugal.com/) and our bike tours, when you open the map there's a whole world of cycling routes waiting for you.

Let's start with Europe.

## The Best Touring Bike Routes in Europe

### The Wine Route in France

If you're a keen follower of fantastic spring classics with a glass of wine in your hand, this is the route for you.

Along kilometers of eco-trails where you'll always be surrounded by vineyards, you'll be able to enjoy not only the beautiful medieval castles of Burgundy, but also explore the countless canals that surround the region and, if you have the legs, conquer the Morvan mountain range.

In the end, of course, you'll have the best nectar of the gods waiting for you to consecrate your victory in this challenge.

### Explore the Amalfi Coast in Italy

Amalfi, Sorrento and Naples, the latter with Etna as a backdrop, are three cities that are part of the beautiful, seductive and picturesque bike tours of the Amalfi Coast.

From beaches hidden in the cliffs to romantic fishing villages, these routes are a challenge not to be missed by any bike enthusiast.

Integrating [bike tours](https://topbiketoursportugal.com/passeios-de-bicicletaportugal/) into your trip can turn a simple visit into a memorable adventure, whether it's through the vineyards of France or along the stunning Italian coastline.



## Touring Bike Adventures in North America

### The Pacific Coast Route in the United States

The scenic and wild beauty of Big Sur, the region that Kerouac captured so well in his novel "Big Sur", is the motto for this route which, through a mix of coastal roads and mountain trails in the coniferous forests so characteristic of the region, runs along the cinematic Californian coast.

### Crossing Canada from Coast to Coast

If it's hard by car, it's even harder by bike. From Newfoundland to Vancouver it's more than 6,000 kilometers, but 6,000 kilometers that promise to make your jaw drop at every turn in the road.

Crystal-clear lakes, indomitable peaks, dense forests and prairies as far as the eye can see are some of the natural diamonds that we will be able to cut with our eyes and legs throughout this trip.

## Exotic Touring Bike Routes in Asia

### The Himalayan Challenge in India

It's high, it's very high, and it's hard, very hard, but that's also why it's so challenging. We're talking about the route that passes through the Ladakh region in the Indian Himalayas, also known as "little Tibet".

Here, the slope is steep, but this isn't even the biggest problem, since the high altitude at which this route is located means that there is less oxygen in the air and, consequently, it is more difficult to make great physical efforts.

### The Natural Beauty of the Hokkaido Route in Japan

On the northernmost island of the Japanese archipelago, a route awaits us that will take us through wild forests and islets that look like the end of the world.

Due to its mixture of harshness and beauty, the Hokkaido Route becomes a cycling mecca between May and November.

## Unforgettable Touring Bike Experiences in South America

### The Carretera Austral in Chile

1200 km long and an almost lunar landscape that reminds us that Antarctica is just around the corner. This is the famous Carretera Austral in Chile, a place where helplessness and dreams intersect in the shadow of the Patagonian mountain massifs and the turbulent rivers that seek to flow into the countless lakes that dot the region.  

### The Inca Trail in Peru

Machu Picchu is a place that indelibly marks the imagination of all of us. If we want this ancient Inca city to cease to be part of the dream world and become a reality in our eyes, we have to take up the challenge of cycling the tough Inca Trail.

### Africa

#### The Adamastor Route in South Africa

It wasn't easy for Vasco da Gama to round the Cape of Good Hope, but the difficulties are no less difficult by bicycle, especially if, from Cape Town, you decide to head east along the Garden Route, a route that we can call the "Adamastor" because of its harshness.

In total, we have 215 km of road and 12 days of travel ahead of us, including, among others, the beautiful town of Mossel Bay, which opens the doors to Tsitsikamma National Park and the wild Addo Elephant National Park.

### Oceania

#### The Southern Cross Route in Australia

The Southern Cross Route or Great Ocean Road, as it is commonly known, is a uniquely beautiful drive that stretches for 276 km along the southern coast of Australia.

Built by Australian soldiers at the beginning of the 20th century, this route takes us from Torquay to Allansford along one of the most scenic roads in the world, where the power of the ocean mixes with the harshness of the coastal rock formations.

## Preparing for a Touring Bike Trip: what you need to know

If a Lisbon bike tour or a bike tour in Porto already require careful and dedicated preparation so that nothing goes wrong during the ride, when you move to Asia or across the Atlantic, logistics will be even more important.

### Essential equipment for touring bikes

Depending on the characteristics of the trail/road and the weather, our experience in organizing bike tours in Porto and the rest of Portugal, it is essential that you always take your bike with you:

\- A GPS system and power bank or a map of the region;

\- A good quality helmet;

\- Comfortable sportswear;

\- An ergonomic backpack;

\- Spare inner tubes and repair kit;

\- Pump for filling tires or CO2 cartridge and filling device;

\- Multi-purpose tool;

\- Cell phone;

\- Raincoat;

\- Sunscreen and insect repellent;

\- Cereal bars, fruit and water.

### Planning and Logistics Tips

As you will have to leave the European Union on most of these routes, it is important that you renew or take out your passport, worry about the potential need for visas and book your flights and accommodation in advance.

We recommend that, once you arrive at your destination, you tell the Portuguese embassy where you're going, what you're going to do and for how long.

Finally, don't forget to respect the local laws and customs and always take out travel and health insurance so that you are prepared for any eventuality.

### Bicycle Care and Maintenance

To avoid problems with your bike during your challenges, it's important to clean your bike after each stage.

In this regard, it's important to pay special attention to the chain and crankset by cleaning them thoroughly and adding oil.

It is also important that you check:

\- the pressure and surface of the tires;

\- tightening the screws;

\- the tension of the rays;

\- the condition of the brake and gear cables.

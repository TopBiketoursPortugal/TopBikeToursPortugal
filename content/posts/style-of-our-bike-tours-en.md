# Style of our bike tours

We like to give freedom to our customers. So, most of our guided bike tours donÂ´t include meals, except breakfast and the usual snacks and water that are always available in the support van.

This allows participants to enjoy their time at lunch or dinner as they please. However, we always offer availability to book restaurant at lunch and dinner time.

The number of people on a guided bike tour can vary from 4 to 30 people. In recent times the trend has been for large groups where participants can meet new people and make new friends.

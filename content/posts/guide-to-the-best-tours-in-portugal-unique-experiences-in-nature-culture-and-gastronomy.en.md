Lusitanian landscape panorama
Portugal's natural landscape provides you with a variety of wonderful settings perfect for exploring on foot.

1. Birdwatching in Gerês
   Experience the tranquillity of the Peneda-Gerês National Park, a true paradise for casual birdwatchers and full-time ornithologists alike.
   This park is a key area for the preservation of biodiversity at national level, offering you the chance to observe countless species of birds in their natural habitat.
2. Trails through the Serra da Arrábida
   The trails of the Serra da Arrábida offer magnificent views of the Atlantic Ocean, as well as a richly diverse flora.
   These trails are like a fusion of maritime and mountain landscapes, which ends up being a breath of fresh air for those who want to escape the urban routine and confusion.
3. Boat trips in the Algarve
   Complement your hiking tours of Portugal with boat trips off the Algarve coast.
   Explore the breathtaking cliffs and caves only accessible by sea and add a touch of the navigator to your adventure in Portuguese waters.
   Portuguese culture
   Immerse yourself in the richness of Lusitanian culture with tours of historic sites and lively local festivals and pilgrimages.
4. Visits to historical monuments
   From the grandiose Jerónimos Monastery in Lisbon to the imposing Clérigos Tower in Oporto, our walking tours never neglect cultural historiography in general and architectural historiography in particular, which is now around nine centuries old.
5. Walks in historic centers
   Walk through the historic centers of big cities like Porto or Lisbon; our tours allow you to experience the charm of old streets and take a closer look at the cultural panorama.
6. Participate in local festivals
   Interact with the local culture by taking part in festivals such as the Santos Populares, celebrating St. Anthony in Lisbon, St. John in Porto and St. Peter in Sintra, in pilgrimages characteristic of certain villages, or medieval fairs in towns to be discovered in the countryside.
   It is these very festivities that represent the unshakeable spirit of Portuguese traditions and our inherent sense of community and hospitality.
   Lusíada gastronomy
   Experience the national flavors through the best tours of Portugal, with a focus on regional culinary specialties.
7. Gastronomic tours
   Get into the spirit of the hiking tours offered by Top Walking Tours and taste local delicacies such as francesinha from Porto or pastéis de nata from Lisbon.
   These tours offer you a palette of flavors that represent the diversity of Portuguese cuisine.
8. Visits to wine-growing regions
   Stroll through the vineyards of the Douro Valley when you sign up for a Douro Valley hiking tour, taste world-renowned, award-winning and acclaimed wines and learn more about the art of winemaking characteristic of this region.

   Each of these walking tours is designed to offer a detailed overview of the many gifts that Portugal has to offer, from its natural landscapes and historical monuments to the best dishes you've ever tasted.

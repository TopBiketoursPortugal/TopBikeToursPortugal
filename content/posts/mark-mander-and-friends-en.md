# **Mark Mander and friends**

Mark Mander is a friend that have done The Way of St. James ( Santiago de Compostela) bike tour with Fold n Visit last April 15 2018.

He have contaced us more than 1 year before to organize a bike tour with a 18 group of friends. Actually we were 19 because one Brasilian girl as joined the gang!

Mark Mander was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 5 years ago. He was a Chief  of Police in Nova Scotia and forced to retire.

This biketour was a goal for Mark and I am quite sure I will  probably meet my friend again some day!

I want to thank you for trust in us and for let me guide you

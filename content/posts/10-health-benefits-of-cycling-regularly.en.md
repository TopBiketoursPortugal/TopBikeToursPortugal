## 10 health benefits of cycling

### 1. Cycling improves cardiovascular health

One of the most important health benefits of cycling is the impact it has on your heart, as pedaling strengthens the myocardium, lowers the resting heart rate and reduces blood fat levels.

This aerobic form of physical exercise has been proven to reduce the risk of suffering from cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks or strokes.

### 2. It's a low-impact type of exercise for all ages

Cycling is a low-impact form of exercise, which makes it an excellent choice for people of all ages and physical shapes.

Compared to running or high-intensity sports, cycling reduces the pressure exerted on the joints, providing a way to exercise your whole body.

### 3. Tones muscles

Although cycling is known for working mainly on the lower body, it also exercises the core and upper body.

This results in toning the muscles in your legs, hips and glutes, while at the same time strengthening your back and abdominals.

### 4. Strengthens mental health

The mental health benefits of cycling are as important as they come - physical activity, especially outdoors, releases endorphins that regulate mood and reduce stress.

Cycling regularly helps to combat anxiety, depression and other psychological/psychiatric illnesses.

The link between mental health and cycling is a valuable one, as it provides a natural way to improve your emotional well-being.

### 5. Improves physical endurance

Cycling is also an excellent way to become more resilient, whether you prefer to climb hills or enjoy leisurely rides; the key here is to constantly challenge your body to increase its level of physical endurance.

Over time, your lung capacity and general endurance levels will also have increased.

### 6. Helps you lose weight

Cycling is an effective way to burn calories and reduce body fat; depending on your weight and intensity, an hour of pedaling can burn between 400 and 1000 calories.

When combined with a healthy and balanced diet, cycling regularly contributes to long-term weight loss.

### 7. Benefits heart health

As well as being an excellent aerobic activity, the cardiovascular health benefits of cycling translate into improved blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.

Your heart stays strong, reducing the risk of developing coronary heart disease in later life.

### 8. Promotes environmental sustainability

It's true that cycling is beneficial for your personal health, but it's also true that it plays a major role when it comes to environmental sustainability.

With fewer cars on the road, cycling helps to reduce the collective environmental footprint - everyone wins, including the planet.

### 9. Increases concentration and productivity

Cycling to work or [taking a leisurely stroll](https://topbiketoursportugal.com/bike-tours-in-portugal/) increases your concentration and productivity levels.

The combination of physical exercise and being outside stimulates your cognitive function and creativity.

When you get to the office, you'll be able to carry out your tasks more clearly and efficiently.

### 10. Improves sleep quality

Cycling frequently helps regulate your sleep patterns - the physical effort exerted balances your circadian rhythms, allowing you to fall asleep more quickly and enjoy a deeper, more restorative sleep.

## Final thoughts

Introducing cycling into your daily routine gives you tremendous physical, mental and environmental benefits.

Whether you're enjoying a bike tour of Portugal with [Top Bike Tours](https://topbiketoursportugal.com/) or cycling close to home, the health benefits of cycling are unquestionable.

The saying goes, and with good reason, that it's "when you're little that you turn into a cucumber", an adage that applies to everything, including cycling.

Who doesn't remember their first bike rides with the "little wheels" attached to the rear wheels and their mother or father's hand ensuring the safety of their first pedal strokes? Almost everyone, I'm sure.

Apart from the ball, the bicycle is the object children feel most affection for, especially because it gives them their first glimpse of freedom and independence.

However, despite all the joy that bicycles generate in children, it is important that their rides are accompanied by the utmost safety, since in addition to potential falls, riding a bicycle presents other dangers, particularly those coming from other road users.

So, if you want to take advantage of the summer to accompany your child on their first bike ride or take them with you on the [Portugal Cycling Tours](https://topbiketoursportugal.com/) you'll find on Bike Tour Portugal, take note of the safety tips we have for you.

## Safety Tips for Cycling with a Child

If, in the case of [Walking Tours Portugal](https://topwalkingtoursportugal.com/), the safety rules are less restrictive, when it comes to bike tours, things take a different turn, especially if you take your children with you.

To make sure everything goes smoothly on your bike ride with your children, take these five safety tips into account:

### Use protective equipment

The first tip, of course, concerns the use of safety equipment.

So, for your child to ride a bike in maximum safety, it's important that they wear a helmet suitable for their age, elbow pads, knee pads and a reflective vest.

If you think that because you're an adult you can get away with not wearing a helmet, don't. This safety element should be worn by people of all ages, regardless of the difficulty or size of the route.

### Choose a bike that suits your child's height and experience

Choose a children's bike that suits the age, height and experience of your little ones. This will not only allow them to ride more comfortably, but will also prevent harmful falls.

If your child is still very inexperienced, consider putting so-called "little wheels" on the rear wheels of the bike.

If you want to take your child on the bike with you, remember to use a specific seat.

### Respect the highway code

Before getting on the bike, give the children a mini-lecture on the highway code where, among other things, you teach them that they should always ride as far to the right as possible and on cycle paths, stop at junctions, only cross the road at crosswalks, always look both ways, even on busy roads, and not use the sidewalks.

Although sidewalks in the middle of a hill or on walkways by the beach or river are not covered by the highway code, it is important that, before your child gets on their bike, you explain to them how to get around in order not only to stay safe, but also to ensure the safety of other road users.

There is also another provision that must be complied with: see and be seen with the use of lighting devices (white light at the front and red at the back) on bicycles.

### Maintain your bike

This tip is for both kids and adults: always have your bike serviced before you go for a ride.

Among other things, keep the chain clean and lubricated, adjust the tire pressure, check the brakes and make sure all the nuts, bolts and joints that make up the bike are tight.

One last recommendation: always take a puncture repair kit and a first aid kit with you.

### Take out insurance

Prevention is better than cure, so if you often cycle with your children on public roads, consider taking out insurance to ensure that, in the event of an accident, all the material and physical costs involved are covered.

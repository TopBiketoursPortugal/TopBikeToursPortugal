# Great Reviews about our bike tours in Portugal - Thanks Bob for it and the photo

## Bike Tour from the city of Porto to Santiago de Compostela

![Bob review about his cycling holiday](/img/bob-review.png "Bob review about his cycling holiday")

My wife and I have now experienced seven European bike tours in various countries. Six were guided as was this one. This tour is a notch above all the others. You are in the constant hands and service of Sergio and his carefully chosen guides. The biking can be challenging at times. We chose the basic package with the meal plan. The accommodation and meals were excellent. If you invest and trust in Sergio, you will be richly rewarded. He is truly one of a kind. If you are as lucky as we were to be matched with kind and generous fellow travellers, you too may also come away with one or more life long friends.

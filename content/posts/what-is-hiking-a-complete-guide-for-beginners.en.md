The stress of day-to-day life and the need for an activity that combines peace of mind with exercise are leading more and more people to seek relaxation away from the hustle and bustle of city life by opting for outdoor activities that put them in communion with nature.

One of these activities goes by the name of hiking.

## What is hiking?

Hiking is, by definition, an energetic, more or less lengthy walk along pre-established trails of low to moderate difficulty.

Open to people of all ages and fitness levels, hiking's main objective is to give walkers the opportunity to discover scenic landscapes and/or landscapes of historical, cultural or natural interest.



For example, there are [hiking tours in Portugal](https://topwalkingtoursportugal.com/) that allow you to discover the Costa Vicentina, the Douro Valley or even the rural Alentejo in a peaceful way.

As a rule, walking these trails takes only a few hours, which means there's no need to stay overnight, to carry large amounts of support equipment or to plan ahead.

In theory, it's not essential to be in good physical shape to take up hiking, but in order to be able to complete more difficult routes, it's important to be fit and healthy and not to have any major health problems.

## Benefits of Hiking

Like any activity that involves exercise, hiking brings us enormous physical and mental benefits:

### Increased cardiovascular endurance

Since it increases aerobic activity, hiking helps to increase cardiovascular endurance, control blood pressure and even lose weight;

### Strengthens the circulatory system

The effort made during hiking increases blood flow in the arteries, veins and capillaries, causing them to dilate and consequently become more elastic.

As a result of this greater flexibility, the transportation of oxygen to the cells in the various parts of the body becomes simpler and more efficient;

### Reduces stress

The best antidote to stress is undoubtedly a walk in nature.

The sounds, the fresh air and the absence of threats are all factors that help our bodies release a greater amount of endorphins which, consequently, end up improving our well-being and emotional balance;

It works the mind so that it becomes more resilient in the face of adversity.

Although hiking trails are not usually very difficult, completing them is always a task that requires focus to overcome the fatigue that will be felt.

Overcoming these difficulties, however small, helps to make our minds more resilient in the face of adversity.

In addition to all these benefits, hiking puts us in front of beautiful landscapes and allows us to get to know cultures and histories in a close and profound way.

### Hiking equipment

The equipment needed for a hiking trip will always depend on its level of difficulty.

However, even on the most demanding routes, all you need is a backpack with a capacity of between 10 and 20 liters, hiking shoes/boots, a water bottle/cantilever and energy bars.

As the routes are pre-established and marked, there is no need to bring a map or any other navigation system.

In terms of safety, this is always guaranteed if the organization is carried out by a specialist company, such as Top Walking Tours.

Anyone who decides to go on their own should bring a cell phone, GPS, Band-Aids, betadine, cream with vitamin E and aloe vera for blisters on the feet and elastic socks/knees.

In addition, you should alert the local authorities of the route you're taking if it's far from populated areas.

## Tips for beginners

If you're tempted to start hiking, take note of these tips:

\- Choose trails for beginners that don't offer any major difficulties;

\- Start with short distances and gradually increase your mileage;

\- Join organizations that promote [walking tours in Portugal](https://topwalkingtoursportugal.com/), as not only will you not be alone during the walk, but you won't have to worry about safety issues or the logistical support you need;

\- Take suitable equipment with you that takes the weather into account;

\- Avoid overloading your backpack;

\- Eat well and hydrate regularly;

\- Stretch after the activity.

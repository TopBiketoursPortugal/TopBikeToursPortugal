# Packing recommendations for a cycling holiday with Top Bike Tours Portugal

It is always important to bring some items for a bicycle holiday so that your ride can be made comfortably.

## **Clothing:**

A pair of *padded shorts* and *cycling Jerseys*. This way you can always have clean shorts to wear, as long as the used ones are washed at the end of each day.

Cycling Jerseys always come in handy with its well design pockets which make them safe for placing your phone, gloves, money, documentation, etc.

Although not an essential item, arm and Leg warmers are very useful if you need some extra comfort.

A light waterproof cycling jacket can fit into a jersey's pocket or into a cycling bag. It is always better to stay on the safe side on longer rides, just in case.

Don't let your hands become sore and bring some cycling gloves with you.

A Buff is very useful to protect your neck and ears from the cold or sunburn.

Bring a helmet. Although not mandatory, you should always wear one. If you don't have a helmet, we will provide you one.

## **Bicycle Bag:**

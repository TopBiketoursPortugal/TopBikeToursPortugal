Just as is happening in the car market, sustainable mobility is winning the hearts and legs of the Portuguese, whose bicycle is their favorite means of transport.

Although purists don't like these new electric-powered bikes very much, the truth is that electrification has made cycling more democratic, allowing, for example, older or less physically able people to visit places that would otherwise be completely closed to them.

In addition to providing interesting and peaceful family rides, electric bicycles also have a number of financial and environmental advantages that make them one of the main means of transportation in the 21st century and are easy to use.

## How does the electric bike work?

E-bikes or electric bikes work like a power amplifier for our pedaling thanks largely to their electric transmission system. This means that, in practice, when we pedal, we are activating the motor which, in turn, reduces the effort required to move the bike.

As we'll see later, there are different types of electric bike, but all of them, without exception, use an electric motor and battery to help us propel the bike. As a rule, this type of bike comes with a controller that not only allows us to choose the degree of pedaling assistance the system provides, but also to turn it off completely.

As with 100% electric cars, electric bikes come equipped with a regenerative braking system that uses the energy from braking to recharge the battery.

With regard to the motor that the battery powers, there are three types of placement of these elements on the bike that ultimately have an influence on the ride.

These are:

### Engine in the rear wheel

This is not only the most common method, but also the most affordable you can find in Portugal.

Although silent, the motor ends up adding weight to the back of the bike, making it more difficult to move and change the tire in the event of a puncture.

### Motor in the front wheel

More common on Dutch-made electric bikes, these types of motors are more resistant than the motors on the back and allow any type of gear system to be fitted.

In terms of disadvantages, there is a substantial loss of agility when handling the handlebars.

### Motor on pedal axle

By having the engine in the middle, these bikes have a better distribution of weight, which makes them easier to control and more stable. Because of this added stability and safety, these bikes are generally more expensive than those with the engine at the front or rear.

## Types of Electric Bikes

As some people may mistakenly think, there is no single type of electric bicycle.

Within the universe of electrified "cycling", there are electric mountain bikes, road bikes, trekking bikes, city bikes and even folding bikes, as is easy to understand if you decide to embark on one of Top Bike Tours' magnificent [bike tours of Portugal](https://topbiketoursportugal.com/), which take you through some of the most beautiful natural and human landscapes in our country and even in Spain.

Although each type of electric bike has been designed with different surfaces, terrain and contexts in mind, they all have in common the fact that they have pedaling assistance.

Note: electric bikes reach maximum speeds of around 25 km/h and the battery has to be recharged using a charger and a socket.

### How to use it?

To start using your electric bike, we recommend that you set the motor assist to a lower power.

Once you're underway, pay attention to the braking time, since it's more powerful and has a heavier frame than a conventional bike, you'll need to brake earlier.

Still on the subject of braking, it should be noted that these bikes come equipped with a disc brake that will ensure greater braking power. Because of these factors, it is advisable to brake as smoothly and evenly as possible.

It cannot be stressed enough that, as with a conventional bicycle, it is important to always wear a helmet and respect the Highway Code.

## Benefits of the Electric Bike

Among the many advantages that an electric bicycle brings with it, the main ones are:

\- They allow you to travel longer distances without a great deal of physical effort, especially on long distances such as tours and bike rides that last for days

\- They are a sustainable means of transportation;

\- They are non-polluting;

\- They are quiet and economical;

\- There are tax benefits for buying them.

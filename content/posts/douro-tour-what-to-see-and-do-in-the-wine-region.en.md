The oldest demarcated wine-growing region in the world is in Portugal and is, if you'll pardon the expression, something to behold, eat, drink and cry over.

Designed by the sacrifice of thousands of men and women who, over the centuries, worked the land to give it the Renaissance painting look it boasts today, the Douro wine region invites us to "get our feet on the ground" and discover why UNESCO considered it a World Heritage Site.

This is how Top Walking Tours invites us on a seven-day "[Douro Valley hiking tour](https://topwalkingtoursportugal.com/hiking-douro-valley-wineregion)" where we can explore the legends, history and, of course, the exciting wine and gastronomic culture of one of the most beautiful natural and human landscapes in the world.

## From the terraces to the wine press: what to see and do during a tour of the Douro Wine Region?

Any walk in the Douro should start on the rails, more specifically on the MiraDouro or the Douro Historical Train, trains that depart from São Bento Station in Porto and take you on a romantic journey along the banks of the Douro River to the heart of the wine-growing region that bears its name.

### Day 2: Pinhão - Vilarinho de São Romão (13 km)

Once we arrive in Pinhão, the historic entrepôt of the Douro valley, it's time to start climbing towards Vilarinho de São Romão, a picturesque village at an altitude of 550 meters, from where we can admire the phenomenal terraced landscape that animates wine tourism in the Douro.

In the middle of the journey, take the opportunity to take a look at the cultivation of the nectar of the gods carried out by the numerous farms along the way and discover the treasures of sacred art in the chapels of Santa Maria and Sabrosa.

Before you can enjoy a well-deserved rest, lie back in the stories and history of the emblazoned Casa de Vilarinho de São Romão, a 17th century building that perfectly encapsulates the transformation of the Douro wine-growing areas into a national and world treasure.

### Day 3: Vilarinho de São Romão - Alijó (18 km)

With your strength restored by a delicious and typical meat stew accompanied by the best Douro wines, it's time to set off in the direction of Alijó, crossing the iconic Pinhão Bridge, the work of Gustavo Eiffel.

Between the ups and downs of the road, stop and enjoy the monumental view from the Miradouro da Capela de Santa Bárbara and explore the religious architecture of Alijó, not forgetting to pay tribute to the monumental Plátano oriental, considered a National Monument, and visit the former Casa dos Távoras, a family that succumbed to the purges of the Marquis of Pombal.

For a well-deserved rest, a little more history, this time through the English nobleman after whom the Pousada de Alijó/Hotel is named: Joseph James Forrester or Baron de Forrester.

This English merchant was one of the big names in the region's wine trade and was forever known as the "protector of the Douro" for his work in studying vine diseases and mapping the valley.

### Day 4: Alijó - São Mamede de Ribatua (15 km)

Prepare to be blown away as the road takes you between man-made terraces and the most poignant natural landscape that is home to protected bird species and sharp boulders which, some believe, are the origin of the word Alijó (from Lijó, a word meaning stony nature).

Amidst all this stimulation of the senses, don't lose sight of the Roman bridge of São Mamede, the Church of São Mamede de Ribatua, the Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Lapa/Sr. do Calvário and, at the end of the trail, the Miradouro de São Domingos, located at an altitude of 700 meters where you can enjoy a privileged view over the entire valley.

### Day 5: Alijó - Vale de Mendiz (13 km)

Now it's downhill all the way. From Alijó, it's time to walk towards Vale de Mendiz, a town considered to be the "Heart of the Port Wine Kingdom" which can and should be appreciated from the dozens of viewpoints that dot the region.

### Day 6: Vale de Mendiz - Pinhão (9 km) + boat/train to Régua

Back to the starting point, but not to return home. The short journey from Alijó to Pinhão has a very pleasant purpose: a boat or train trip to Régua, the capital of the Douro wine region.

Once in Régua, you can't miss the fabulous Douro Museum and its permanent exhibition "Douro: Matter and Spirit", which will give you a temporal and geographical overview of this demarcated region and the people who worked and enriched it.

In addition to the museum, don't miss a visit to the metal bridge over the Douro, the Monument to Aviators Gago Coutinho and Sacadura Cabral, the riverside ecotrail and the historic center, which transports you at a glance to Régua at the beginning of the 20th century.

At the end of the day, it's time to visit and sleep in the iconic giant wine barrels of Quinta da Pacheca.

If your trip coincides with the grape harvest season, you can also take guided tours of the estate and take part in the imaginative treading of the grapes in the press.

### Day 7: Régua - Lamego (18 km)

All good things come to an end and, unfortunately, our tour is no exception.

On this last day, it's time to head to the city where the monumental sanctuary of Nossa Senhora dos Remédios is built, not only a center of worship, but also the focal point of the festivities in her honor that take place between the last Thursday of August and September 9.

About a month earlier, the center of Lamego was taken by storm by the now unavoidable Zigurfest, a festival of modern arts and music that took place in the last week of July.

Back on the road, a challenge: to climb the vertiginous Varosa Dam staircase.

And so ends our tour of the Douro, but not without first taking note of the fantastic gastronomic delicacies we have to warm your stomach.

Gastronomy in the Douro: a delicious compromise between ingenuity and simplicity

If, in terms of wine, there's no arguing with the fact that every meal should be washed down with the tranquil and refined Douro and Port wines, when it comes to gastronomy in the Douro it's difficult to choose.



Despite the difficult choice, before or after your [hiking tours in Portugal](https://topwalkingtoursportugal.com/) through the Douro region, don't miss out on these five dishes:

### Bôla de Lamego

Born in the 19th century, Bôla de Lamego is one of the most iconic dishes in Douro cuisine. Ideal for a snack, the bôla is made with fluffy pastry that can be filled with salpicão, chorizo, ham or even codfish.

### Roast kid

Due to its rugged terrain, cattle are replaced by goats and so, due to the unevenness of the terrain, we end up with the famous roast kid in a wood oven on our tables.

The kid is usually accompanied by oven-baked rice and roast potatoes or chestnuts.

### Cozido à Transmontana

After a day's hiking or grape harvesting, the body needs strong, nutritious food and that's what Cozido à Transmontana gives us.

Made with a wide range of ingredients and smoked meats from the region, this dish typically cooked in iron pots also includes a huge variety of other meats and vegetables.

To accompany it, the unavoidable oven rice made from the water used to cook the meat.

### Mirandese Steak

From Miranda do Douro comes the "Posta à Mirandesa", a beautiful piece of meat the size of a palm that goes through the coals before being brought to the table accompanied by potatoes and a salad of peppers.

### Cavacas from Resende

To accompany the Port wine, we have a delicious traditional dessert: Cavacas de Resende.

Made by hand and baked in wood-fired ovens, these typical cavacas from the municipality of Resende are the ultimate example of how simplicity is the key to good living, as they only use eggs, flour and sugar.

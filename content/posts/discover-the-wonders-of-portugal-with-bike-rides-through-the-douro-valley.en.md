"The prodigy of a landscape that ceases to be by forcing itself out of proportion. It is not a panorama that the eyes contemplate: it is an excess of nature. Terraces that are the footsteps of titanic men climbing the slopes, volumes, colors and modulations that no sculptor, painter or musician can translate, horizons expanded beyond the plausible thresholds of vision. 

A virginal universe, as if it had just been born, and already eternal in its harmony, its serenity, its silence that not even the river dares to break, sometimes furtively disappearing behind the hills, sometimes stunned at the bottom reflecting its own amazement. 

A geological poem. Absolute beauty", Miguel Torga in "Diário XII".



The words that we lack when we visit the Douro Valley could well be those with which the poet and writer from São Martinho de Anta makes his declaration to the Douro that saw him born.

A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Douro is an enchanted valley where wine is the appetizer to open a book of human and natural stories that deciphers the soul of those who visit it for the first time and strengthens the desire to return or even, who knows, stay.

This is the Douro, a landscape full of life that makes us want to live in a poem, a poem that could very well be written aboard the iconic historic Douro train or, in a much closer and more immersive way, by electric bicycle.

The roads wind and are only as tough as a João Almeida, but there is another much simpler, and why not say it, romantic option that will unite you with the surrounding landscape: Top Bike Tours' bike tours.

Founded in 2013, Top Bike Tours is a company specializing in cycling and walking tours that offers those who aren't afraid of adventure and are looking for a more human vacation experience a series of routes that focus on contact with nature and historical and human heritage in Portugal and northern Spain.

One of these routes takes travelers from Porto (transfer by train to Pinhão) to Régua, in 8 days and 7 nights, where the fabulous landscape of the Douro wine region blends with rustic handicrafts, the flavors of the gastronomy of its people and even the Paleolithic heritage of Foz de Côa.

If you're curious and ready to get on the electric touring bike provided by Top Bike Tours, come and see some of the wonders you can enjoy during these magical days and nights in the Douro Valley.

## Day 1: Porto – Pinhão (train transfer, 110 km)

This will certainly be the easiest part of your trip, but one that will most stir your senses, since the 110 km between Porto and Pinhão are, without any kind of favor, the most beautiful train journey in Portugal.

Until you reach Quinta da Rosa, where you'll spend the night, let yourself be carried away by the terraces that mark the landscape of the oldest demarcated area in the world.

## Day 2: Pinhão – Vila Nova de Foz de Côa (74 km)

After a good night's sleep in the comfort of Quinta da Rosa, it's time to have a good breakfast and get on your bike for a ride to Ervedosa do Douro, the capital of the iconic Bedford vans which, for several decades, have been a picture postcard of the Douro wine harvest.

From there to the Wine Museum in São João da Pesqueira, where you'll learn a little more about how the nectar of the gods has been produced over the centuries, it's just a short hop.

Reinforced with knowledge and wine tastings, you'll continue on to the Côa Valley Archaeological Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, where you'll witness the primitive art that humans from other eras have left immortalized in the schist.

## Day 3: Vila Nova de Foz Côa – Figueira de Castelo Rodrigo (42 km)

From Paleolithic art, the third day of this [Douro Valley bike tour](https://topbiketoursportugal.com/douro-valley-full-day-bike-ride) takes you to Figueira de Castelo Rodrigo, a town where Roman, Visigothic and Arab influences combine with one of the best preserved examples of Manueline architecture in Portugal.

In addition to the architecture, along the way you'll be dazzled by a landscape marked by almond trees (it's worth noting that they're in bloom between February and March) and numerous medieval castles that take you back to times of enchanted Moors,

## Day 4: Figueira de Castelo Rodrigo – Marialva (60 km)

After an initial climb to Pinhel to loosen up your legs, Marialva, a land named after the well-known Marquis of Marialva, welcomes you with open arms to show you the ruins of the old town, the castle of Marialva and the best of 18th century equestrian art.

## Day 5: Marialva – Penedono (27 km ou 72 Km)

On this stage, you can choose between a 72 km route that takes you through Trancoso, a town located at an altitude of 993 meters with a historic center full of numerous monuments of civil, religious and military architecture, and a 27 km route that, although it will save your breath, will not spare you the unique beauty of the mountains that testify to the resistance of the vineyards to the test of time.

## Day 6: Penedono - circuito (40 km)

As with many cycling events, this [Portugal bike tour](https://topbiketoursportugal.com/) also has a 40 km circuit in store to give you the chance to get to know the soul of Penedono.

In addition to the architectural landscape marked by the granite Castle of Penedono and the fountain adorned with a royal crown of King Manuel I, the surrounding landscape has the inevitable centuries-old vineyards and majestic chestnut trees.

## Day 7: Penedono – Régua (52 km)

For the last day on your electric bike, Top Bike Tours has a trip to the capital of the Douro Valley: Régua.

After rolling along terraces built by human sweat and ingenuity, you'll find Régua with the Douro at your feet and Port wine in every glass.

To finish off the evening in style, you'll head to Quinta da Pacheca, one of the most faithful custodians of the Douro's wine-growing heritage. 

Day 8 would be the transfer back to Porto

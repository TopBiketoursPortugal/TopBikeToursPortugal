      I'm Miguel, a dedicated tour guide born in the picturesque town of
      Amarante. With a degree in tourism from Universidade de Trás-os-Montes e
      Alto Douro, I've been passionately immersed in the world of guided tours,
      specializing in cycling adventures that showcase the beauty of our
      country.


      My roots in Amarante run deep, providing me with a profound understanding of portuguese cultural tapestry and hidden gems. As your guide, I'm not just here to lead; I'm here to share the stories, local insights, and scenic wonders that make Portugal truly special.


      What sets my cycling tours apart is my personal connection to the sport. For over five years, I've embraced the thrill of downhill cycling, fostering a profound love for the open road and the adventures it unfolds. This firsthand experience fuels my commitment to creating cycling holidays that not only explore our stunning landscapes but also capture the spirit of two-wheeled exploration.

      My name is Telmo. I'm 26 years old, born in Guimarães, and have been
      living in Porto for 4 years. My academic journey led me to explore Sports
      Sciences.


      Moreover, cycling has been a constant in my life as long as I can remember, and biking through the city has allowed me to discover new places in a unique way. This connection with physical activity and exploration has led me to reflect on the richness of experiences that the world offers.


      However, my true passion lies in people's stories. I love socializing and uncovering the unique narratives that each individual carries. This inherent curiosity about people's lives aligns perfectly with TBT's mission, where the diversity of cultures and stories is celebrated.

  - bio: '"Born in 1962, Pedro used to work on the banking business. "I dedicate
      myself now to my old passion : cycling". Pedro started working at the age
      of 14 in the Portuguese banking market and during this time he studied at
      night. Being an enthusiastic adept of sport, he has since a very young age
      played handball, football, karate and windsurf. But it was in cycling that
      he found is identity. "This is a sport in which we impose our limit in
      each cycling route and at the same time it gives us a sense of adrenaline
      and exceptional freedom." Occasionally he participates in competitions in
      order to develop physical form, but not seeking exceptional results. From
      these we can highlight the 600km of Brazil Ride, 24h MTB Lordelo , the
      NGPS stages in the north of the Portugal and the XCO championship from
      Vila do Conde. Crossing the land with his mountain bike, he already cycled
      the pilgrimage routes to Santiago from Porto and from France, the paths to
      Fátima and the Great Route of 22 Historic villages of Portugal. Pedro
      occasionally participates in guided bike tours, when he is available.'

## How was Top Bike tours Portugal Born?

All started from the owner’s experience as a cycling passionate, who decided to overcome all difficulties and make a cycling trip to Santiago de Compostela. It started as a simple shop only focused on bicycle rentals and maintenance. However, the owner’s objectives were much larger and undoubtedly related to tourism. And that way was Top Bike tours Portugal born, seeking to provide an adequate service to customer needs, showing the best that cycling has to offer without the stress of having to plan, and organize, everything, and thus providing the best possible experience, whose value is the key ingredient in the ultimate satisfaction of the customer.

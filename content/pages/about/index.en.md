      Marta was born in 1996: "Since I was a little girl, my biggest dream has
      ever been to become a tourist guide, because I love to discover new people
      and new ways of thinking. I went to the university to study tourism and,
      in the end of all of it, this job opportunity appeared in my way. During a
      whole month period, my colleagues prepared me to become an expert in this
      field, being supportive all along the way. Finally I had my first tour. It
      wasn’t long after that I also had my first review. That was, in itself,
      the best payment anyone could ever have had, because in this way I touched
      the heart of the people by showing them the amazing culture my city has to
      offer. I am a sports girl. I practiced badminton, karate, swimming and the
      bicycle was my transportation for everywhere. I speak English and Spanish,
      and my joy is to take my time to make your vacations worthwhile and
      memorable."

      "Born in 1962, Pedro used to work on the banking business. "I dedicate
      myself now to my old passion : cycling". Pedro started working at the age
      of 14 in the Portuguese banking market and during this time he studied at
      night. Being an enthusiastic adept of sport, he has since a very young age
      played handball, football, karate and windsurf. But it was in cycling that
      he found is identity. "This is a sport in which we impose our limit in
      each cycling route and at the same time it gives us a sense of adrenaline
      and exceptional freedom." Occasionally he participates in competitions in
      order to develop physical form, but not seeking exceptional results. From
      these we can highlight the 600km of Brazil Ride, 24h MTB Lordelo , the
      NGPS stages in the north of the Portugal and the XCO championship from
      Vila do Conde. Crossing the land with his mountain bike, he already cycled
      the pilgrimage routes to Santiago from Porto and from France, the paths to
      Fátima and the Great Route of 22 Historic villages of Portugal. Pedro
      occasionally participates in guided bike tours, when he is available.

## How was Top Bike tours Portugal Born?

All started from the owner’s experience as a cycling passionate, who decided to overcome all difficulties and make a cycling trip to Santiago de Compostela. It started as a simple shop only focused on bicycle rentals and maintenance. However, the owner’s objectives were much larger and undoubtedly related to tourism. And that way was Top Bike tours Portugal born, seeking to provide an adequate service to customer needs, showing the best that cycling has to offer without the stress of having to plan, and organize, everything, and thus providing the best possible experience, whose value is the key ingredient in the ultimate satisfaction of the customer.

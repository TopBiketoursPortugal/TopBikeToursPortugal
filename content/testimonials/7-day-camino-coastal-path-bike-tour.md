title: "###### 7 Day Camino Coastal Path Bike Tour"
quote: >-
  I found this trip to be fabulous from start to finish. Sergio, Jose and Pedro
  went out of their way to be helpful, and to meet the different needs of
  everyone in the large group.The route had its challenges, with cobblestones,
  some steep dirt pathways and some city streets to maneuver, but Jose and
  Sergio worked very professionally to keep the group safe no matter what the
  terrain or riding conditions. Pedro would meet us with the support van at
  designated spots to top us up with water and snacks. The bikes were very well
  maintained, and got the once over by our guides after every day of riding to\

  make sure they were ready to go for the next morning. Our hotel accommodations were very well appointed, (with an extensive buffet breakfast always included), and every day we had a hearty lunch at a restaurant en route, as well as multi-course dinner at each of our destination cities along the way.\

  With the spectacular coastal scenery, the top notch guides, and the camaraderie of the group, this was one of the best cycling tours I have ever experienced.

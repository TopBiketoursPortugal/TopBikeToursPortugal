title: "###### 6 day cycle Port to Santiago de Compostela"
quote: >-
  18 of us went with Fold-N-Go and it was a great decision. Sergio and crew went
  well above and beyond in tour support. Coming straight from an Nova Scotia
  winter with little ability to precycle/train as well as some inexperienced
  riders the trip was a challenge but was well supported.This was our groups'
  3rd European bike trip and by far the most rewarding.\

  \

  We had ZERO complaints! I never fill in these reviews but this is the tour company to select. Sergio is building his company and gave immediate attention to any request no matter how minor.\

  \

  '2 thumbs up!'\

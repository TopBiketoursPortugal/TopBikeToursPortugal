  My brother and I made our way to Porto to embark on this tour which we were
  doing as unsupported self guided. The service we got from Sergio and his staff
  was nothing short of spectacular. Starting from Henrique's guided city tour of
  Porto to the amazing hotels they arranged to the great bikes they provided,
  everything was first class. Sergio checked on us during the week to make sure
  there were no problems and made us feel like friends not customers\

  The one thing I would mention is I would not classify this as an easy ride.

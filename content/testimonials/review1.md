title: "> ###### ...it was a great experience not to be forgotten."
quote: We have recently completed the Silver Coast bike tour. We chose to have E
  Bikes but I hardly used it as virtually flat the whole way. From the first
  decision to do the tour we were more than happy with the communication had
  with Sergio. On the first morning we met Sergio in the hotel and went through
  the itinerary for us. We then had a bike fitting and a practice ride. This was
  followed by Tiago taking us on a walking tour of Porto guiding us around all
  the historic places of interest ending up in a local port warehouse for an
  explanation on the life of making Port then came the tasting. On the morning
  of departure Sergio rode with us out of the city and sent us on our way. All
  of the accommodation was 4 star and of excellent choice. The riding was flat
  and some small amount on roads but most on cycle ways. Interesting riding
  along the coast small villages large towns through fire ravaged forest
  beautiful beaches. Having a GPS is an advantage to help navigate some of the
  towns. 2nd to last day there is a challenge but once at the top of the hill
  amazing views both up and down the coast. We did have a problem with one of
  the bikes and is was no problem for Sergio to drive down and replace the bike
  for us. I can highly recommend Fold n Visit and like that it is a small and
  personal company. Thank you Sergio and Tiago it was a great experience not to
  be forgotten.

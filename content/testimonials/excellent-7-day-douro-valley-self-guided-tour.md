title: "**Excellent 7 day Douro Valley self-guided tour!**"
quote: What an incredible trip!! Sergio from Top Bike Tours curated a wonderful
  week for us with excellent hotels and routes. Surpassed our expectations! The
  little extras like a walking tour and wine tastings at different stops were
  thoroughly enjoyed as well. We had a few issues on Day 2 with some flats which
  were addressed the next day so all was good. We opted for e-bikes due to the
  climbs and we were glad we did. The descents were thrilling and something we
  will always remember. Would recommend this company if you want to tour
  Portugal! We loved our trip!

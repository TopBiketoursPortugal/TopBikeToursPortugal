title: "###### Bike Tour from the city of Porto to Santiago de Compostela"
quote: My wife and I have now experienced seven European bike tours in various
  countries. Six were guided as was this one. This tour is a notch above all the
  others. You are in the constant hands and service of Sergio and his carefully
  chosen guides. The biking can be challenging at times. We chose the basic
  package with the meal plan. The accommodation and meals were excellent. If you
  invest and trust in Sergio, you will be richly rewarded. He is truly one of a
  kind. If you are as lucky as we were to be matched with kind and generous
  fellow travellers, you too may also come away with one or more life long
  friends.

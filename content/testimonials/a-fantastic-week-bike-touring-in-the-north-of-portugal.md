title: "###### A Fantastic week bike touring in the North of Portugal"
quote: >-
  I organised a group of 6 late 50’s/ early 60 year olds who are all very
  occasional recreational riders to do this ride. Fold n Visit modified their
  North of Portugal self-guided itinerary for us by starting in Castro Laboreiro
  so that we could experiences the beautiful mountains in the north, but without
  the pain of big climbs.\

  Sergio provided an excellent service -\

  The bikes were new or near new....two in the group opted for e-bikes. The power boost was rarely used as the ride is easy...mostly on cycle paths, many sealed or on boardwalks. The power option however did provide “peace of mind” for those that had it. Between 6 of us, we had a couple of flat tyres and a chain jumped off...all easily rectified.\

  The accommodation was excellent......generally 3 or 4 star.\

  The route planning and GPS helped us to easily stay on track.\

  \

  Sergio was a pleasure to deal with....everything that was promised was delivered and at a very reasonable price.\

  \

  May was a great month to be there...Spring flowers and fresh growth on deciduous trees, generally cool (rarely more than 20 degC), but not too cold. A fresh following breeze as we headed down the coast and not too busy.

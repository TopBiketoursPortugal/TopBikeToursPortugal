title: One of the very best bike tours we've ever taken.
quote: Outstanding bike tour! My husband and I have taken many bike tours; both
  domestically and abroad. This trip was absolutely excellent; the route, the
  quality of the bicycles, the accommodations and (best of all) the guides. We
  learned about the Camino, enjoyed spectacular scenery along Portugal and
  Spain's coast and celebrated with all the Pilgrims when we reached Santiago do
  Compestela. We had every level of cyclist on the trip and all of us enjoyed it
  immensely. I would recommend Sergio and Top Bike to anyone.

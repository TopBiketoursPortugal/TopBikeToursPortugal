title: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SERGIO AND TOP BIKE TOURS PORTUGAL
quote: My husband and I led bicycle tours in Nebraska for 30 years then started
  taking small groups to enjoy cycling adventures in Europe in 2018 with our new
  organization, Hound Dog Cycling Adventures. We contracted with Top Bike Tours
  Portugal for a 10-day trip which included cycling from Portu, Portugal to
  Santiago, Spain along the beautiful Camino coastal route. Sergio and his team
  of professionals provided top notch bicycles, support and guidance. They were
  very detailed oriented, accessible, caring, polite and most of all FUN! We
  know how difficult it can be to take care of cycling groups on these types of
  trips--they exceeded our expectations and expertly helped us through some
  challenging situations (beyond our control). We highly recommend Top Bike
  Tours Portugal and would love to come back and do another tour someday.

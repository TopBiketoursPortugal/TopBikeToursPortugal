title: "###### Wonderful bike tour of the Duoro Valley!"
quote: My family recently did a 7 day bike tour through the Duoro Valley with
  Sergio (driving the van) and Henrique (our guide). We had the most fabulous
  week! The route chosen by Sergio was perfect and the scenery was different
  every day. We stayed at beautiful Quinta's each night where we either ate
  dinner with the family (which was very traditional) or went out to great local
  restaurants. We also got to have unique experiences with the families (port
  tasting, olive oil visits, palaeontology visits etc). Henrique was the best
  guide we could have wanted. He was very friendly and enthusiastic and provided
  us with a wealth of information about every city, church, region, etc. Both
  Sergio and Henrique were extremely professional and went above and beyond to
  make our week the best it could be! We wouldn't have changed one thing! Thanks
  Sergio and Henrique!!

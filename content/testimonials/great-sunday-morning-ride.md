  **Great Sunday morning ride**


  "The route was quite easy to ride with no up and down hills. Most part of the route is done on bike lanes along the river until the beach which made me feel more secure. The guide was extremely handy, always available to explain some historic details of some interesting points that we were finding along the route.\

  I definitely recommend this sightseeing Bike Tour, It's a different way to explore and know the city"

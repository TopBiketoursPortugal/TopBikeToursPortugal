title: "**Minho and North Portugal - a beautiful place to cycle**"
quote: >-
  We went on the Minho and North Portugal self guided tour. We had an e-bike and
  a hybrid bike, both very well maintained. The Too Bike staff were excellent
  and friendly. Guidance came from a bike GPS unit provided by Top Bike, which
  worked a treat and gave easy-to-follow navigation. However we had paper copies
  as back up. We were taken by van with the bikes from Porto to Melgaço. From
  there we cycled back to Porto over five great days of riding.\

  \

  The scenery was superb, the route was varied, including surfaced cycleways, cobbled lanes, woodland tracks, and a few short sections of shared road. Most of the route was traffic free.\

  \

  The hotels were excellent, each one with its own character. Our luggage was always there on our arrival, and there was always somewhere safe to store the bikes. We found lots of fascinating places to stop and look at en route.\

  \

  All in all, thoroughly recommended.

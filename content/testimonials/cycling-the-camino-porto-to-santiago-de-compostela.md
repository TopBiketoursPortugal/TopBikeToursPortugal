title: "###### Cycling the Camino Porto to Santiago de Compostela"
quote: We are a senior couple from Canada, ages 71.5 (wife) and 77 that booked
  directly with the company and chose the basic unguided bike rental package.
  This included one hybrid bike and an electric assist bike for the wife, second
  tier hotel accommodation, the shuttle of our personal luggage between hotels,
  and a walking tour of Porto. We appreciated the personalized service given to
  us by insuring that we had the right size bikes, providing us with an
  emergency phone and Garmin GPS unit for route finding, and keeping in contact
  with us daily via email. All the hotels were able to provide us with breakfast
  with the exception of the one in Caminha. This latter hotel served breakfast
  too late and it was in a very noisy location with loud people on the street
  leaving club(s) between 5:30 to 6:30 a.m. Overall, the accommodations provided
  met our expectations. The cycling route worked out by the company exceeded my
  expectations and we appreciated that there was a good attempt to be faithful
  to the designated Camino which was not intended for bikes. The alternate
  routing needed in some places worked out really well. The GPS track was a
  necessity and hugely better than relying on maps. As for the of the itinerary
  of 6 days, the distances set by the company worked out really well and allowed
  us to complete each day at a reasonable time (as early as 2:30 p.m. and as
  late as 5:30 p.m.). Our average start time on the road was between 8:30 and
  9:00 a.m. with a later start at Caminha because of the ferry crossing times.
  We truly enjoyed to long boardwalks along the beaches in Portugal.There are
  challenging sections on the route including steepness, as well as, rough and
  sandy trail surfaces, the kind of challenge I expected but could be
  overwhelming for some people. Keeping the latter in mind, I highly recommend
  this self-guided adventure.

title: Great support and equipmen
quote: I did a week long solo bike ride in northern Portugal and then a 10 day
  solo bike ride from Porto to Lisbon. The company provided excellent support.
  They texted often to make sure things were going OK. When I had questions
  (sent via WhatsApp), they provided short videos to show me what to do. The
  tools they provided me were used to fix two flat tires. The GPSes and phone
  app were used each day (it took me a couple of days to figure out the GPS).
  The paper maps were not used as they were not needed. The luggage transport
  worked just fine. I would use this company again. But, next time, I will look
  for cheaper trips as I do not need 4 and 5 star hotels. Portugal has way too
  many streets with cobblestones (hard on my knees). The routes had more turns
  than I wanted, so spent lots of time looking at the GPS (to keep on the route)
  instead of at the scenery. The route visited more beaches than I needed.

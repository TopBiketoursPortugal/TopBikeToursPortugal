title: Best trip ever! Top bike tours exceeded our expectations
quote: >-
  The bike ride was a wonderful experience, going through small town villages,
  and along the coastline of Portugal and Spain. We rode 25 to 40 miles per day
  on various terrains. The bikes were exceptional for our tour. We met wonderful
  people along the way and rode along side, new friends from Brazil, the US and
  Canada. Our guides were exceptional and Sergio paid great attention to detail
  in our hotels, our meals and all accommodations. He is a very gracious man and
  he made us feel part of his family. Arriving to Santiago cathedral in Spain
  was a most uplifting and spiritual part of the trip. You felt the genuine
  faith among the people and we were grateful to be able to participate in this
  wonderful pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela .\

  We would definitely do another tour with Sergio and Top Bike Tours.

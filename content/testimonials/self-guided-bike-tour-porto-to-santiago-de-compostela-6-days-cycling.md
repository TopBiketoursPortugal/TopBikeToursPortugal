  #### Self-Guided Bike Tour Porto to Santiago de Compostela - 6 days cycling
quote: >-
  Sergio and his team did themselves proud - congratulations. This is a bike
  tour with a difference....from the excellent personal service, to the included
  walking tour of Porto, to the interesting and varied ride, to the high
  standard of the hotels especially the absolute gem Torre de Rio at the end of
  day 5.\

  The ride for the most part follows the Portuguese Caminho way, so is not always smooth and easy, but this is to be expected by its very nature, and adds to the challenge.\

  My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the trip and unreservedly recommend it to all enthusiastic cyclists.

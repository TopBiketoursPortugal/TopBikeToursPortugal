title: An intimate way to see Portugal with wonderful guides
quote: >-
  It had been awhile since we went on a cycling trip. We've always gone on
  regular bikes. This time we chose e-bikes. Our group was a mix of regular
  bicycles and e-bikes, yet it was still cohesive. We did the 9 day Lisboa to
  Lagos trip, which was a mix of both road and off-road cycling. The landscape
  was spectacular and at times dramatic. The accommodations were varied,
  comfortable and some extraordinarily wonderful. The food was delectable.\

  Our team, Sergio, Jo達o (John) and Jo達o (Christmas) were top notch: supportive, helpful, knowledgeable and fun. They love their country and loved sharing it with us. It was a memorable trip, and we would happily do it again. A heartfelt thank you to Sergio, John and Christmas!!!

quote: I booked 14 people in my group to do the 8-day guided cycle ride down the
  Vicentine Coast (Lisbon to Lagos) in late October-Nov. We've done numerous
  bike tours with several companies. Each one has their strengths and
  weaknesses. Top Bike Tours Portugal can be relied upon to give you a
  challenging biking experience with quality guides that make every effort to
  keep you happy on your trip. Portugal has so much to offer providing a great
  experience and value. Sergio is the hard-working owner of the company. He and

  adventure.

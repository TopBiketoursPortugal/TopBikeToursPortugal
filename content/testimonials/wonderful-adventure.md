  Our party of eight did the eight day self-guided Camino de Santiago E-Bike
  Tour. Wonderful trip! The scenery was spectacular, the e-bikes were almost new
  (two of them were brand new), the GPS route finding was excellent, the hotels
  were all very comfortable, and the baggage handling was flawless. Most of the
  riding was on dedicated bike paths, backroads, or elevated wood paths. There
  were a few short sections of sand that required pushing the bikes and a few
  busy stretches of road (all with good shoulders). Two memorable hotels are
  Parador de Baiona in Bayona which is inside a castle, and Torre do Rio in
  Caldas Dos Reis which is in a remodeled 18th century textile mill featuring a
  waterfall pool and spectacular gardens.\

  The GPS guidance takes you from door-to-door of each hotel on the tour. We got off track at least once per day but with the GPS it is easy to get back on route. I recommend using both the Garmin GPS provided by Top Bikes and the "Ride with GPS" route that Top Bike will help you load on your phone at the orientation session.\

  \

  We had a few days of rain near the end of the trip but fortunately it came in short intense bursts that we could wait out in a sheltered spot. We did the tour in early September so it was quite warm. I recommend taking a bike raincoat and possibly a helmet cover. The panniers provided by Top Bike are waterproof.\

  We are already planning our next self-guided bike tour!

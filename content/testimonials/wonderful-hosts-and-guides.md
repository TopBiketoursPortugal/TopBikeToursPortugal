quote: We were treated to a great tour of Porto the day before our tour to
  Santiago Spain started. It was wonderful. The tour itself was nothing short of
  amazing. The hotels were top-notch and an experience in itself. The owner of
  Topbiketours made sure everything went seamlessly and made our journey
  memorable.

title: "###### Gold Standard for bike tours!!"
quote: I have been cycle touring in Europe for over twenty years and hands down
  this was the best trip I have ever taken. Check every box. Sergio the owner
  takes great pride and makes every effort to make the experience wonderful.
  Fantastic scenery. The best hotels, one of which was the best hotel I can ever
  remember staying at. The bicycles were new and performed flawlessly. Every
  detail was covered from pick up at the airport, fitting bicycles, walking tour
  of Porto the day before departure on our ride, 4 star hotels, GPS units with
  route outlined, pick up at the end of our trip and transport back to the
  airport. Finally I have to add that Sergio's staff were all super friendly and
  helpful. Except for one day of pouring rain which is out of anyone's control I
  would have to say the trip was perfect.

title: A BRILLIANT lifetime memory biking with TBT from Porto to Santiago de
  Compostela, via the Camino
quote: A BRILLIANT Lifetime memory provided by Top Bike Tours Portugal! We biked
  over a week from Porto to Santiago de Compostela! Sergio and the team took
  great care of us from the moment we arrived. The journey, the path, "the
  Camino", the way of the Saints from Porto is soo wonderful, along the Atlantic
  Coast with provincial village scenes mixed with pastoral meadows, beaches,
  pastures with grazing animals. While TBT Portugal didn't create all of that
  scenery, they made our trip so easy and pleasurable with our stays in
  fantastic hotels ( 2 castles!), and bringing us to the city centers to enjoy
  lunch and breaks. TBT Portugal does a GREAT Job!

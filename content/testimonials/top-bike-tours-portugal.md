title: Top Bike Tours Portugal
quote: The bike routes were scenic and well thought out. The group always had a
  lead and a sweeper to ensure that no one got lost. The van carried all luggage
  to the destination. Portugal is a beautiful country and our route was a
  wonderful way to experience it. Food was great. Lodging was great. Great trip.

title: Absolutely wonderful experience
quote: >-
  My wife and I did the St.James way on bicycles with Top Biketours Portugal,
  The owner and tour guide Sergio was wonderful. Sergio picked us up at the
  train station in Porto and fitted us to our brand new mountain bikes. The next
  day John gave us an excellent walking tour of Porto.\

  \

  We had a group of nine with ages ranging from 84\

  to 40. Five of the group had e-bikes and the remainder of us had regular bikes.Everyone in the group were so nice and became great new friends.\

  We stayed in some fantastic hotels and two castles. The food and comradely was wonderful.\

  \

  The only trip that comes close to this bike tour was hiking the Inca trail to Michu Pechu.\

  \

  We will come back and do the Southern route\

  with Top Biketours of Portugal.\

  \

  Thank you Sergio for all the wonderful memories.

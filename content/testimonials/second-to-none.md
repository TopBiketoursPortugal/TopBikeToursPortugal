title: Second to None!
quote: >-
  My husband and I had the unbelievable pleasure of cycling the Coastal Route of
  the Camino de Santiago with Top Bike Tours Portugal. There wasn’t one thing I
  would have changed about this experience. We are in our 60s, and knew we
  wanted an experience that would have us staying at nice hotels with warm
  showers along the way. This and every other exceptional detail was provided by
  Sergio and his expert team.\

  \

  When we first met in Porto, Sergio introduced us to his crew, our fellow riders, and the bikes that would be carrying us to Compostela. Our bikes were amazing — strong, current, and extremely well-maintained. We were each provided with a saddlebag to carry anything we wanted along the journey. Our luggage was transported by van to the hotels while we made the daily journey by bike. One of the crew would act as our guide, cycling ahead of us and making sure everyone stayed safe and relatively together. We’re so glad we chose that option as we wonder in retrospect how we would have found many of the smaller more obscure trails.\

  \

  By the end of the trip, guides Sergio and John both seemed like family. They each went out of their way to make sure that every person completed a ‘bucket list’ adventure. Thank you, Top Portugal Bike Tours! We will never forget you or the 5-star experience you provided.

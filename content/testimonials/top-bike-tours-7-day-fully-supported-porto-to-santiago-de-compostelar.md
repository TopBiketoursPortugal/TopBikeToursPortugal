title: "###### Top Bike Tours 7 day fully supported Porto to Santiago de Compostelar"
quote: This is a top class Top Bike Tour. Well organized. Very efficient
  management and guides, good value for money (even with $NZ), fantastic
  accommodation and top support along the way from start to finish. Top English,
  top humour, top local knowledge, top scenery top equipment and top bikes. It
  was great fun, there were 9 on the tour and it went better than clock work. We
  were well watered along the way and provided with snacks and fruit if you
  wanted them. We stopped at interesting attractions along the way museums, fish
  market, local towns and villages. The distances and terraine each day were
  well structured and very manageable on E Bikes. Each night an option for
  dinner was arranged if you wished to participate. These were on the whole
  exceptional and well priced, better than you would likely arrange yourself.
  Sergio, owner/manage/guide and his trusty young sidekick, Henrique were the
  nothing short of fantastic in their care, organisation and local knowledge.
  Well done guys. We hope to see you again.

title: "**Great riding with Top Bike Tours in the North of Portugal and Minho**"
quote: >-
  We did a lot of research into riding in Portugal and after looking at a lot of
  companies went with Top Bike Tours and selected the North of Portugal and
  Minho ride.\

  The reason we went with Top Bike is the personal service we received from Sergio when looking to book. We are in Australia and even with the net, dealing with someone across the other side of the planet has challenges but Sergio worked through everything with us, made changes to hotels we wanted, provided good local advice etc and made the whole booking thing easy.\

  We looked at other ride companies but Top Bike are Porto locals and know the North of Portugal very well.\

  When we arrived in Porto, Sergio's team picked us up, briefed us on the bikes, equipment, GPS, trip route, everything. They then took us for a walking tour of Porto which was unexpected and gave us some very good local tips e.g. riding along the Atlantic, train trip up the Douro, local site, cafes etc.\

  After lunch in Porto the transfer to the north from Porto was easy, they booked us into our first nights hotel, Hotel Rural Reguengo de Melgaço, gave us some local tips and then let us be.\

  We then had the best 6 days of riding. Well planned ride, great paths, great local tips for coffee, lunch, sites on the way, dinner. Checked in on us from time to time to make sure everything was going okay, but mainly left us be to enjoy ourselves and make our own way.\

  Pick up for return to Porto was without fuss and we were returned to Porto from Ponte de Barca with more local tips and advice for staying in and around Porto.\

  Overall. we had the most enjoyable time.\

  That had a lot to do with what Sergio and his team had put together.\

  A well planned itinerary.\

  A well planned riding route which took us through little villages and off the beaten track. Good equipment, the bikes were near new, well serviced and ran well.\

  GPS, a Ride with GPS app, hard copy back up maps and daily itinerary.\

  Very good hotels, who were very welcoming and had great local breakfasts.\

  Efficient and easy bag transfer.\

  Overall, great support.\

  If I had any tips it would be to check out the hotels on tour on line well before you book. Some of them are well out of town, which is fine if you want that, but if you want a post ride drink or dinner, we found it nice to know how far we'd be walking distance to town. Having said that, we were not sure about the first nights accommodation at Hotel Rural Reguengo de Melgaço near the village of Melgaco. The hotel was quite out of the way and a long way from the village of Melgaco. Turns out it was absolutely terrific. After arriving at the hotel we rode up to Melgaco in the afternoon for a drink, and then rode back to the farm/hotel as it got dark. We then walked to a small village nearby and found a local restaurant, Adega do Sossego. The locals looked a bit surprised to see us, but the hospitality, service and food was terrific. In the morning we discovered we were the only couple in the hotel, but the lady running the hotel was there to greet us with a great breakfast. She couldn't speak any English and us no Portuguese, but she wanted to show us about the farm which was beautiful and had it's own chapel. Turns out the place had previously been the home of the local Baron from some time ago. A great start to the ride and obviously good advice from Sergio and Top Bike Tours.\

  Special mention to the locals. Very welcoming friendly people and so patient with our poor language skills. Lovely people.\

  Highly recommend this company on the basis of our experience.

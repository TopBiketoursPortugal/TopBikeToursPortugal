quote: >-
  Agency prepared for us 11 days self-guided bicycle tour from Porto to Cascais.
  Communication with Sergio was before and during the tour prompt and problems
  solving. Selection and preparation of e-bikes was very good and according to
  our wishes. Chosen hotels were suitable, sometimes out of center, sometimes
  without proper bike storage. Some parts of the routes were uncomfortable and
  too challenging for us.\

  In genreal it was an excellent journey, with remarkable landscape and very pleasant local people.

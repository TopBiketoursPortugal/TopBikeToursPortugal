title: A trip that I will never forget!
quote: >-
  My wife and I did the 7 day self guided Porto to Lisbon reduced route with Top
  Bike Tours Portugal the first week of Ocrtober 2022.\

  I must give Sergio and his team a ten out of ten on all aspects of our trip. The orientation in Porto on day 1 was thorough, the equipment excellent and we were treated to a guided walk through Porto followed by a complimentary Port wine tour/tasting.\

  At the start of our trip Miguel guided us out of Porto and ensured that we were familar with the GPS and tour literature that was provided. It was so nice to be led out of the busy city and start our self guided trip on a lovely seaside path on the south side of the Douro river.\

  The whole trip was outstanding. The coast was beautiful and most of our biking was on excellent bike paths or quiet backroads. About 10% of the trip was on busier roads with good shoulders, never a problem.\

  The hotels that they booked us into were all excellent, four star or boutique. Breakfasts were very good and our baggage was always waiting at our evening destination. Every night Sergio checked in to ensure that all was going well.\

  We were fortunate that the weather was perfect for the whole trip. On our last day we were picked up in Obidos and transported to the hotel that we had booked in Lisbon.\

  We booked with Top Bike Tours because they are a local Portuguese based company and I am so happy that we did so. They are very professional, so helpful and proud to share the beauty of their country to us.\

  All of their team are avid bikers and such nice people. You cannot go wrong with this outfit.

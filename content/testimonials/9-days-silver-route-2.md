title: "###### 9 days Silver Route 2"
quote: Our group of 4 just finished the Silver Route -2 trip, self-guided. It
  was amazing! Sérgio was terrific in all aspects. He helped us put together a
  program that had us cycling through the countryside, up and down mountains,
  and enjoying the coastline for 9 days. This is highly recommended, but make
  sure you have some fitness, as there are some good climbs!

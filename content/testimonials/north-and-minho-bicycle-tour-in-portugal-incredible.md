title: "###### North and Minho bicycle tour in Portugal- INCREDIBLE!!!!!"
quote: >-
  For our honeymoon, my new husband and I did the 7 day Northern Portugal Bike
  Tour. It was absolutely incredible, probably one of the best/most memorable
  trips we've done in all our travels.\

  Sergio met with us the morning we arrived in Porto and shared with us an outline of our 7 days, with just the right amount of details. We knew the directions, distances, and topography for each day of our ride, plus a brief description of the route, and suggested places along the way to explore, have a bite to eat, and experience the treasures of Portugal. The terrain was flat and comfortable riding through such a variety of bike paths, trails, cobblestone paved neighborhoods, vineyards, corn field, and wooden boardwalks.\

  The outline gave us plenty of flexibility to choose our "adventure for day" and opened our eyes to a much more intimate and local feeling experience of the country and Portugese culture.\

  Some of our highlights included....Discovering our first night’s stay off the Camino de Santiago Portugal in the historic castle town, Valenca, on the border of Spain.\

  The bike ride through the farmers’ fields and along the Lima River, taking in the sunset at the Cathedral in Viana do Castelo.\

  Riding along the coast, taking in the seaside landscape and passing through many small, traditional fishing villages.\

  This was an unforgettable experience! It was perfect for the two of us that like the flexibility and autonomy of traveling on our own, yet it provided just the right amount of directions and accommoda

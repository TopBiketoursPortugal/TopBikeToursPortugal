title: "**Self guided Girls Trip- Silver Coast Portugal**"
quote: Fun and Easy! We are four ladies meeting for the first time since Covid
  for a fun filled girls outing. We decided to opt for a self-guided tour
  offered by Top Bike Tours in Porto. Sergio and his team were extremely well
  organized from picking us up from the airport/train station to the minute
  details of where to go (GPS/App) and the what-ifs. We did have a couple of
  what-ifs and Jo達o and Sergio were always available to see us through. A flat
  tire (repaired via WhatsApp) and a seat that kept sliding (Sergio came to our
  hotel and repaired it immediately) wonderful service. This is a honest and
  good organization. As for the Silver Coast itself, simply wonder! The Estuary
  and the famous natural reserve of S. Jacinto Dunes was enough to rejuvenate
  one. Thank you Jo達o for gentle manner and kindness. We also thank Sergio for
  making this trip possible with such ease. You have a beautiful country. Hilda

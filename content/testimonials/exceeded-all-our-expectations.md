  Exceeded all our expectations!\

  In early June 2022 my wife and I joined a group of international travelers for an ebike trip along the Camino from Porto to Santiago de Compostela.\

  This trip with Top Bike Tours Portugal was guided by owner Sergio and his assistant João. We were immediately impressed with their great coordination and professionalism during a week of fun riding and exploring.\

  The tour began in Porto with a “meet and greet” at our hotel on the day before the ride to get aquainted and get fitted properly to our ebikes. Being ebike owners, we were impressed with the quality of the equipment and instruction. Our group had many riders who had no experience on an ebike and they all learned very quickly how to optimize the electrical assistance when needed. This would come in handy at various points along our route when we approached an incline or daunting looking hill. The call among the group came to be “Turbo!”when the lead was starting a climb, as this was the maximum assist level on the bikes, and it made the climbs almost effortless‍️\

  One our first morning of the ride we gathered at the bike shop to begin the first leg of our journey. Sergio and João led us along coast bike paths of beautiful scenery. The route each day was well chosen to be easy and safe for all, with plenty of breaks for snacks and water.\

  An additional highlight for us was that the group was made up of new friends from Canada, Brazil, Australia, Portugal and the US. Our conversations around the table at lunches and dinners opened a window into another world of cultures we were unfamiliar with an excited to learn about. This was an unexpected bonus that created new friendships\

  Everything about the trip was well planned for safety, comfort, scenery and variety,and FUN!\

  We rode on bike paths, boardwalks along the dunes, dirt trails and a very limited number of smaller roads, with the occassional crossing of roads. Sergio and João planned ahead so the support van blocked traffic if we had to make any crossing of a busy road. Our safety was their priority.\

  The trip was also well paced to fit all of our riding capabilities.\

  We can’t say enough good things about our group of riders. We ranged in age from 45-72 yrs and bonded right away This was all due to Sergio being a great lead and João an exemplary assistant. João was a wealth of information on the history of Portugal, its olive oil and cork industries and almost any question you might have.\

  In summary, we have done lots of city bike tours on ebikes, but this was our first long trip(300km). We had a wonderful time and plan to do more trips with Top Bike Tours‍️\

  If you are considering a bike trip in Portugal we can’t recommend highly enough contacting Sergio and his great team at Top Bike Tours Portugal. You will not be disappointed!\

  Boa Viagem!

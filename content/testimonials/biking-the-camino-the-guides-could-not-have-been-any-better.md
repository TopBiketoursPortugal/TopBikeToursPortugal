title: "###### Biking the Camino the guides could not have been any better"
quote: Recently my wife and I traveled with 18 others from Canada to Porto . The
  bikes were top notch and new or almost new. The guides took very good care of
  us and we felt safe at all times. They went well beyond what they needed to
  when I needed medical help(nothing related to the biking) and made the
  experience as smooth as possible. The accommodations were first rate. I have
  done a number of biking trips in Europe and the guides and support team was by
  far the most helpful. I would recommend them to any one.

title: "**Great Porto to Coimbra bike ride**"
quote: >-
  Top bike Tours of Portugal provided an exceptional experience for an unguided,
  independent bike tour of the Portugal coast between Porto and Coimbra. Top
  Bike Tours set up the route and hotels along the way, arranged for our luggage
  to be picked up each morning and transferred to the next hotel. They provided
  well maintained Trek bikes, and a computer that had each day's ride programmed
  in (via a variety of trails/bike lanes/secondary roads that keep you off the
  main roads for most of the ride). We started in in Porto, and rode down to
  Coimbra over 5 days where we dropped the bikes off at our hotel for TopBike to
  pick up. Sergio and Top Bike also arranged extra hotel days in Porto at the
  start of the ride, and additional days in Coimbra and Lisbon at the end of the
  ride.\

  \

  I'd highly recommend them for biking in Portugal, either for an independent trip, or on one of their guided tours.

title: Excellent self guided tour, first class service.
quote: We completed the Porto to Santiago ride via the coastal route which
  included a very informative city tour of Porto on the first day which was a
  nice touch, The tour followed a large portion of the Camino way so was on
  tracks with other walkers. It did therefore require some good bike handling
  skills (our's improved along the way). The customer service from Sergio was
  first class. He responded to all our emails very quickly. We gave him some
  feedback on some of the trails that had deteriorated and he immediately
  investigated and altered the trails for subsequent tours. We did a self guided
  tour which relied on a GPS. The maps were VERY accurate finishing right
  outside the front door of the hotel at the end of each day. Great and varied
  scenery and very enjoyable.

  **An enjoyable bike ride of Porto and the nearby seaside**
quote: >-
  "When I mentioned that I was going to be doing a bike tour in Porto, the
  locals thought I was crazy. After all, the city has many hills and steep
  inclines along the riverbank, so I was a little apprehensive about booking
  this tour. I am now happy to say that I'm glad I did - it was great and not
  too exhausting. You don't have to be a professional cyclist to enjoy this
  tour; as long as you have ridden a bike with gears and feel up for a light
  workout (the same you would get from walking many of Porto's hills), you will
  be fine.\

  \

  Our guide, Marta, started the tour by getting us comfortable with our bikes and providing some local knowledge on the city's history and customs. We then rode down to the river bank and made our way out to the seaside. After stopping at a cafe for a quick break, we made our way back along the longest avenue in the city.\

  \

  The bikes were 21-speed mountain bikes in good condition and our guide was equipped to deal with any issues e.g. flat tyres, chains, and gears. I found the route we took was easy for everyone; we avoided steep hills and instead took a long way around the city so that about a third was downhill, a third was flat along the seaside, and the final third was a gradual climb to the end of the tour. By the end, it was a little bit of a workout to get the blood pumping, but not enough to completely exhaust you"

title: "###### Electric Bike Tour holiday to Santiago de Compostela"
quote: >-
  This was an amazing ride. We had previously done the Silver Coast so this was
  the next step up for me. The electric bikes were great...I wouldn't have been
  able to do it without it. The scenery throughout was stunning ranging from
  coastal to mountains to farm fields and forests.\

  The accomodation was just "WOW" ranging from hotels to old forts and castles.\

  Our arrival in the square was very electric with all the others who had completed there journey the atmosphere was alive with happy joyous people having completed their journey.

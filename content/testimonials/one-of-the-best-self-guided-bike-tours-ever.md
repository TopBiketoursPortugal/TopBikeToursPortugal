title: "###### One of the best self-guided bike tours ever!"
quote: >-
  I just got back from my bike tour of the Camino coastal path. I can't say
  enough nice things about Sergio and his team Enrique and Tiago . They really
  made everything happen right on this ebike tour that my friend Jeff and I
  took. Every detail was taken care of and the route was interesting and well
  supported. Even when I wasn't able to ride one day because of a health issue,
  Sergio made accommodation for me.\

  I had a great time and can't wait to go back again with my wife and daughter.\

  The trip was very fairly priced, many excellent and memorable hotels, and the bikes worked well. thank you Sergio,Tiago, and Enrique

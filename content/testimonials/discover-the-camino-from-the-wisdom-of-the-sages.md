title: Discover the Camino from the Wisdom of the Sages
quote: I have walked through the magnificent mountains and rivers of South
  America, experienced the primitive features of Antarctica, and also sighed at
  the appearance of the Amazon Valley, but only the trip to Camino really made
  me feel that the eternal light of human civilization and wisdom is something
  we are proud of and The light of the soul that needs to be sought. This
  journey is not only the praise of five stars, thank you for your guidance,
  this is the light of my heart

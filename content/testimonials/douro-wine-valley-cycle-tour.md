title: "###### Douro Wine Valley Cycle Tour"
quote: Sergio arranged a really great 5 day (6 nights) tour for me with
  breathtaking views of Douro valley, interesting and challenging off roads,
  quite and tranquil back countries, and comfortable and quaint accommodations
  to relax in at the end of each day. Sergio took great care of us (there were
  another couple whose tour dates were the same as mine), checked from time to
  time to see how we are doing, any questions or problems we might have, and
  shared with us much information on the local culture. His other staff are also
  great, friendly and knowledgeable about their city. Sergio arranged for a free
  walking tour of Porto as part of the package, and when we were at Pinhao he
  took us to a vineyard for port wine tasting. We were equipped with GPS with
  turn by turn instructions, no way to get lost. Douro valley is a beautiful and
  serene place to cycle, sometimes you feel like you have the whole place just
  to yourself. The villages and towns along the way are not touristy at all,
  very much maintained its local way of life. A great way to see beautiful
  nature and way of life in the wine country of Portugal. Really recommend a
  visit to the archeological site of Foz Coa to see the rock art our ancestor
  left us over 20,000 years ago and hear about the fascinating history of how it
  was discovered and the fight to preserve an important part of human heritage.
  Miss the nature, the sun and tranquility of Douro wine valley. Fold'n and
  Visit is the company to go with when you want to book tours in Porto or the
  countryside around it. Really recommend it for their service, care, attention
  to details and hospitality.

I did a two-night, self-guided tour of the Douro Valley with an e-bike. Very well planned and organized. Luxury accommodations. The GPS and printed maps were easy to follow, plus I downloaded an app with the planned routes. Very professional service that made my trip easy and fun! Highly recommended!

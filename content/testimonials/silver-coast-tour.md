title: "**Silver Coast Tour**"
quote: I thoroughly enjoyed my sole, self-directed bike tour from Porto to
  Coimbra. The tour offers a nice balance of coastal scenery, historical sites,
  museums and beach time. The TBTP staff are friendly and helpful and the hotels
  were high quality and well located. I would gladly ride with TBTP again!

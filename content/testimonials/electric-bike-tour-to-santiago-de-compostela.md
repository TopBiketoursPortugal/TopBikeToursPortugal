title: "###### Electric Bike Tour to Santiago de Compostela"
quote: >-
  This is our 2nd tour with Top Bike Tours of Portugal the 1st being the Silver
  Coast. Sergio put together a fantastic tour to Santiago de Compostela
  following one of the Camino Trails.\

  Porto is an amazing city to start the rides with plenty of things to do and see and if you have a like of seafood your in the right place.\

  The accommodation was excellent the whole way even staying in old forts, castles and hotels. The bikes were excellent and very comfortable. Having the Garman GPS helps you keep to the trail and are easy to operate. The tour followed the coast on bike trails and then riding through villages and forests was amazing. We passed many walkers on the Camino Trail and found everyone to be very friendly calling out Bom Camino as we ride by.\

  The finish in Santiago de Compostela was incredible, riding into the square seeing all the people celebrating their achievement.\

  There were plenty of places to pick up morning tea, lunches and dinners. Breakfasts were included.\

  I certainly would recommend Sergio and his team at Top Bike Tours of Portugal.

title: "###### Wow!!! Wow!!! In my 60o's not been on a bike since 8, A
  mindblowing hands on experience"
quote: We did the 6 day Silver Coast Bike Tour, down the Portugal Coast from
  Porto to Coimbra. As I did not choose this trip myself, my expectations were
  40/100. Once I got home and took in the whole experience, my expectation
  exceeded by 100%. I have travelled and done a few things, but none that has
  given me such a hands on, incredible experience like this. Sergio couldn't do
  enough for us. We had an awesome trail on the GPS, gave us great bikes AND WE
  NEVER FELT UNSAFE. The areas we biked into you wouldn't come across by car,
  and the local things you saw on the way I can't begin to describe, the
  magnificent whole scenario.

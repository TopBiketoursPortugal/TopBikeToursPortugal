title: "###### Extraordinary customer service and trip experience"
quote: "I had the pleasure of organizing 18 friends from Canada on this
  extraordinary trip. From day one we were taken care of and totally immersed in
  the Portuguese and Spanish culture. Sergio, Jose and Pedro provided us with a
  safe, scenic and inspiring journey along the Camino. The challenge of cycling
  on the cobble stones and the sometimes-rough terrain made it all that more
  worthwhile. It in the end gave you the sense of accomplishment, that you
  earned the Compostela. The mixture of the beautiful coastline and interesting
  people we met along the way made the trip all that much more enjoyable. In
  Sergio, Jose and Pedro we found more than just a touring company. We found a
  group of people who are committed to the customer experience and needs. Along
  this extraordinary journey we also found folks we can truly call friend:
  Sergio, Jose and Pedro. This is my 3rd cycling trip and by far it was the
  best. I would highly recommend this company, this trip and the Camino."

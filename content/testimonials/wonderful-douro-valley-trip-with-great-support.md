title: "###### Wonderful Douro Valley trip with great support"
quote: >-
  We did the Douro valley 6 day easy cycle trip with this lovely local company
  run by passionate cyclists in September. We were very unlucky to hit a patch
  of unseasonal rainy days but still enjoyed the sensational scenery. We elected
  to skip one day of riding which was just too wet and windy to be fun, and
  company were happy to transfer us, luggage and the bikes in a van. Luggage
  always arrived at next destination before we did, went very smoothly.\

  \

  The trip was marketed as 'Douro very easy' one but a word of caution - it had some rather steep hills. We are merely amateur cyclists! My husband was challenged (but coped) but I'm less fit and ended up opting for an electric assist bike (very glad I did, it helped on the big hills). Suggest you know your own limits and look carefully at the trip terrain maps to make sure it's good for you. There are some flatter routes (eg Portugal Coast trip) for different abilities. Bikes were great quality.\

  \

  The routes and places we visited were just wonderful, and Fold n Visit found some fantastic accommodation for us, great variety and very enjoyable. Although not designated bike paths for the most part, the roads were good surfaces, were quiet and felt safe. Great villages on the visit, diverse scenery - felt we saw the real Portugal. Very rural and peaceful, very relaxing. Foz de Coa palaeolithic rock art was a highlight as was the beautiful Hotel in the ruins of a castle. Staying on a working farm (Quinta) was great fun too. We selected the deluxe accommodation and think it was well worth it.\

  \

  We had one glitch with a broken bike chain and got terrific personal support to fix it. The best thing about this young business is they really want you to have a fantastic experience and will go 'above and beyond' to make that happen. The service was completely personal and tailored to our interests and needs, you aren't just another person in a big group.\

  Portugal is a beautiful country with amazing diverse scenery, cycling was a great way to see it. Happy to support and thoroughly recommend this great local business.

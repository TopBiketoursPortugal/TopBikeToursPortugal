title: "###### Silver coast bike trip"
quote: My husband and I just completed the Silver Coast bike tour with Sergio
  and Henrique last week. It was our first fully supported bike tour. The tour
  was wonderful! Everything was pre-arranged from lodging ( 4-5 star resorts
  along the coast) to meals and transportation and other details by Sergio and
  his staff. They were fun to be with and guided us through routes that had
  little or no traffic. Their historical knowledge led us to interesting museum
  and sites along the way. There was always time for a coffee break! I would
  highly recommend Top Bike Tours for your Portugal bike trip!

  7-Day The Way of St James Bike Tour- The Coast Path - Camino to Santiago.\

  My wife and I who are the wrong side of 65yrs.did this cycle trip recently guided my Sergio and back up by John in the van looking after stuff like our refreshment needs along the way, light entertainment through pleasant conversation and transportation of our luggage . We had the best fun on a holiday for years despite the physical exertion of cycling approx.280km in 6 days which wasn't a bother urged on by our fellow cyclists a most cheerful sprightly bunch of companions you could hope to end up with without prior arrangement .The comfort of "playing follow the leader "who was our man Sergio was really the icing on the cake and added to our confidence dealing with mixed terrain including main roads and traffic .For non habitual cyclists we really loved the experience and would have no hesitation in doing something similar again in the not too distant future with Top Bike Tours.

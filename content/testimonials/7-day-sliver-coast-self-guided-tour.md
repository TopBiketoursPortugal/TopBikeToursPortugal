title: 7 day Sliver Coast self guided tour
quote: First time doing a self guided tour. Great experience, mostly ridding on
  bike paths along the water or in low traffic areas. Beautiful scenery. Sergio
  and his team were excellent, from fitting the bikes, explaining the route etc.
  checked up on us every evening to make sure we were ok. I would recommend this
  easy to follow route with Top Bike tours to first time riders.

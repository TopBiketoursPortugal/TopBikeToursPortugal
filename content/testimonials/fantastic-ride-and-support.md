title: "###### Fantastic ride and support"
quote: We did a self-guided tour and Serio and his team provided wonderful
  support. We did the coastal route. We got new bikes equipped with a GPS
  programmed for each day's ride, restaurant recommendations, and ongoing
  support. The ride itself was beautiful and meaningful to ride along the
  beaches in Portugal and the walking trails in Spain. It was great to be on the
  pilgrimage path so many have used over the centuries.

title: Porto to Coimbra, Excellent!
quote: >-
  Porto to Coimbra bike tour, self guided.\

  Outstanding! Would definitely use this outfit again.\

  Sergio was quick to respond to emails and cheerfully made last minute changes to our hotel reservations that we were forced to make due to unforseen circumstances.\

  Bikes, directions, hotels were all four stars, top notch. We upgraded to superior room/ocean view and didnt' regret it. Sergio was generous allowing us to use the bikes a day previous to our tour in porto and two days after our tour in Coimbra with no extra charge. He also added "bar ends" to my handlebars at my request with no extra charge. He checked in with us each day to make sure all was good.\

  \

  My only quibble was the GPS device used for navigating. the screen is small and hard to see in the sun. Sergio made a correct point though, that these devices last longer than a cell phone on an all day journey. I found it easier to use my cell phone to navigate with Ridewithgps.com route, (that sergio also provides the link to these routes!). but my cell phone wouldn't last the whole day biking. Also, when it rained I had to put away my cell phone, while we could leave the GPS device still on the handlebars without worry. Next time I will strap an auxillary battery to the bike so I can use my cell phone the whole day to navigate with ridewithgps route.\

  \

  Coimbra was our final destination. We spent three nights there. In retrospect two would have been better, or even just one. . Easy train from Coimbra to Lisbon. (side note: If you do Sintra on your tour, I would do at least two nights there. Sintra was the highlight of our portugal tour. It was a train day trip for us from lisbon. we liked it better than lisbon).\

  \

  We are hoping to come back soon and do porto to santiago compostela tour with Sergio.

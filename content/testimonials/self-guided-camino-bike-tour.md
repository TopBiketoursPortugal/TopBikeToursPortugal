title: Self-guided Camino bike tour
quote: We did a self-guided bike trip from Porto to Santiago. An amazing trip -
  beautiful and fun with varied terrain and scenery. Our bikes were perfect, and
  the GPS (once we got it all figured out) provided all the direction we needed.
  They chose great hotels and lovely sites to see. I can't recommend this highly
  enough.

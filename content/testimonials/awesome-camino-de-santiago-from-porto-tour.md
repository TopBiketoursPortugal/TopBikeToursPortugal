title: Awesome Camino de Santiago from Porto Tour
quote: We did the bike tour to Camino de Santiago from Porto. Sergio and the
  entire Top Bike Tours have been nothing short than amazing. They are so
  responsible and prepared, they have lots of knowledge about the path and
  surroundings, they were prepared with tools, water, snacks, tools and spares
  to make the trip as smooth as possible. They booked us at the most amazing
  hotels making the experience even better, people on other tours saw the hotels
  we stayed at and felt their experience was so underwhelming compared to ours.
  I had done other bike tours and this was so much better than previous ones. I
  truly recommend this company.
